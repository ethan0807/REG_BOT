14–12. Liability of nonappropriated fund activities
AR 215–1 authorizes the loan of specified items of appropriated fund property to nonappropriated fund activities of the
Army. In such cases the activity rather than the person who signs for the property assumes personal responsibility. Theactivity is not regarded as being an insurer of the property, but is financially liable for a loss under paragraph 13–41.An action to hold a nonappropriated fund activity financially liable for the loss of appropriated fund property does notnegate the right of the activity to hold, in turn, its officers or employees financially liable.
