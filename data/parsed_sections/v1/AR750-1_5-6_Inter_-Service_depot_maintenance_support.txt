5–6.  Inter -Service depot maintenance support  
a.  The Joint depot maintenance program is applicable to all acquisition and logistic support activities 
planning, requiring, or providing depot maintenance support. The primary objective of this program is to 
achieve increased effectiveness through use of the  combined service depot maintenance resources. This 
reduces redundant capabilities while sustaining essential mission support needs. Depot maintenance in-
ter-Service support will be used and provided to the maximum extent possible.  
b.  ACOMs, activities, a nd organizations will seek mutually beneficial support arrangements with other 
Army organizations and with other Services and/or agencies when feasible and not detrimental to mission 
and military requirements.  
c.  ACOMs, activities, and organizations will  provide support to other Services and/or agencies to the 
extent possible within given capabilities, and when not detrimental to the mission and military require-
ments, upon request.  
d.  A Joint depot maintenance support plan ( DMSP) will be developed by th e MSCs for all cases where 
the same supportable materiel system is being procured for use, or being used, by two or more military 
services. The Joint DMSP will be submitted to AMC for approval before implementation. Each plan will — 
(1)  Include an asses sment of existing depot maintenance capabilities of the military Services involved.  
(2)  Indicate the basic considerations for inter -Service support and how the proposed depot mainte-
nance assignments make maximum use of existing DoD capabilities and reduc e to a minimum the need 
for new investment in additional resources.  
(3)  Indicate the planned distribution of depot maintenance workloads among the Army, other DoD, and 
commercial sources over the expected life of the materiel system.
