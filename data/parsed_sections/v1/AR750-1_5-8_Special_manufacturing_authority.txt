5–8.  Special manufacturing authority  
a.  Special manufacturing authority ( SMA) is defined as the authority to manufacture, modify, or fabri-
cate parts, supplies, or components or other materiel within the Defense Logistics Agency ( DLA) inven-
tory beyond what is required to support depot level maintenance  requirements. AMC may approve depot 
manufacturing that directly aligns with a depot’s CITE.  
b.  Army depots, through their assigned LCMC, will request approval from AMC to perform manufactur-
ing workloads that are not directly related to an assigned re pair program prior to accepting such workload. 
AMC may approve SMA for depots to manufacture such materiel when the work directly aligns with the 
depot’s CITE designation.  
c.  Army depots will coordinate directly with the three primary manufacturing Ars enals through AMC to 
align manufacturing workloads to the appropriate activity as early as possible in the decision -making pro-
cess. The three primary Arsenals include: Rock Island Arsenal and the Joint Manufacturing and Technol-
ogy Center, Illinois; Pine B luff Arsenal, Arkansas; and Watervliet Arsenal, New York.  
d.  Army depots will provide AMC, through their LCMC, an annual report that identifies all approved 
SMA for the previous FY by the last business day of each October. The report should include th e details 
for each SMA granted, to include the monetary value of such workloads. AMC must provide DCS, G  –  4 
(Sustainment Maintenance Division), a copy of such report by the first business day of each November.
