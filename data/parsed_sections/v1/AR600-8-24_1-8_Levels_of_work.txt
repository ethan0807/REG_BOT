1  –  8.  Levels of work  
Most personnel work in the field is performed at three primary levels: unit, battalion (BN), and installation (or some 
equivalent of an installation).  
a.  Unit- and BN -level work is performed at these respective levels.  
b.  Installation -level work requires an understanding of the organizational structure. Work at the installation falls 
into two major categories:  
(1)  Command and Staff (C&S) work includes tha t work required to manage the personnel strength of a command 
and to support the commander’s decision process. The headquarters elements of all ACOMs are responsible for C&S 
work (brigades within Army divisions are notable exceptions). C&S work includes th e release from AD, discharge, 
retirements, eliminations, special correspondence, and personnel actions requiring a commander’s decision.  
(2)  Personnel support work is that work performed by either the Military Personnel Division (MPD) or as a part of 
the base operations support structure. For U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) active guard reserve (AGR) Soldiers, personnel 
support work is performed by personnel service support teams (PSSTs).  
c.  The guidance in all chapters will address the following levels of work:  
(1)  Soldier.   Work beginning with input from a Soldier.  
(2)  Unit.   Work executed at unit level.  
(3)  Battalion.   Work executed at BN level.  
(4)  Command and Staff.   Work executed within the chain of command and by staff elements (other than the BN or 
brigade within a division).  
(5)  Personnel support.   Work executed in a personnel support organization. The specific personnel support work 
centers required to perform the work for manpower purposes covered by this regulation are Personnel Plans and Ac-
tions (PPAAs), transition center (TC), and Soldier actions (SACTs).
