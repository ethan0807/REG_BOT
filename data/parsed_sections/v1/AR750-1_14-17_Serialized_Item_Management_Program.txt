14–17.  Serialized Item Management Program  
a.  DoDI  4151.19 establishes a serialized item management ( SIM) program, which tasks the Military 
Departments and Defense Agencies to — 
(1)  Identify populations of select items (parts, components, and end items).  
(2)  Mark each item in each population with a UII. 
(3)  Generate, collect, and analyze maintenance, logistics, and usage data about each specific item.  
b.  The overarching goals of the Army SIM is to increase weapons system readiness, reliability, and 
safety; create life cycle asset visibility; and prov ide a reduction in ownership costs through enhanced, effi-
cient, and effective weapons system sustainment operations. These goals will be achieved by creating a 
global, unified supply chain ––one that is capable of projecting, sustaining, maintaining, and re constituting 
combat power under the full range of operational scenarios ––that performs with complete visibility and 
control of all relevant assets, equipment, and materiel.  
c.  This policy applies to all Army activities and directs the development and exec ution of broad -based 
SIM programs that make data about specific items, unique within their respective total populations, readily 
available for life cycle management.  
d.  SIM programs will enable an effective life cycle management of items by identifying populations of 
select items (parts, components, and end items), requiring all items within these select populations to be 
 
marked with a UII, and enabling the generation, collection and analysis of logistics data about each 
uniquely identified item.  
e.  All Army activities will update applicable policy directives, regulations, and pamphlets for which they 
are the policy proponent. In addition, AIS and related software will be updated as required to implement 
this policy. To optimize the process, all refere nces to management by serial number will be modified to 
require and enable management by UII.
