officer in the grade of SFC or above; civilian employee GS–7 or above, or a wage leader (WL) or wage supervisor(WS) employee. Chaplains may not be appointed as investigative officers. For financial liability investigations ofproperty loss conducted in joint Service activities, financial liability officers may be any DOD commissioned orwarrant officer, or a noncommissioned officer in the pay grade of E7 or above assigned to the activity. Additionally, aforeign national employee, GS–7 equivalent or above, may be designated to act as a financial liability officer onfinancial liability investigations of property loss originating within a civilian support center. Federal recognition of anARNG member constitutes authority to be appointed as a financial liability officer.
b. Appoint as financial liability officer only those individuals who are senior to individual(s) subject to potential
financial liability. Senior by time in grade (TIG) or pay band is acceptable. Refer to table 13–1 to determine the propergrade of a financial liability officer. If the financial liability officer discovers during the investigation that completionof the investigation will require them to examine the conduct or performance of duty of someone senior, or may resultin a finding and recommendation adverse to a person senior to them, the financial liability officer will report that factto the approving authority. The approving authority will review the findings, and either excuse the financial liabilityofficer and designate another person senior to the individual concerned, or direct the investigation to continue ifmilitary exigencies make the change impractical. When employing the military exigency option, the approvingauthority will document the military exigency as an exhibit to the DD Form 200.
c. No person may act as the financial liability officer who is personally responsible for, or is in any way directly
interested in the property listed on the DD Form 200.
