3–5.  Maintenance resourcing  
a.  All Army organizations that have the responsibility to maintain  and repair equipment will be ade-
quately equipped, staffed, and funded for that purpose. The PPBE process will be used to implement this 
policy. Staff advice and assistance in resource development for maintenance programs will be provided to 
ACOMs, ASCC s, DRUs, and ARSTAF by the DCS, G  –  4. 
b.  MTOE and deployable MTDA organizations will be augmented in peacetime garrison operations 
when maintenance Soldier availability of maintenance man -hours is less than the MTOE and/or MTDA 
projected wartime a vailability of maintenance man -hours. This policy is to ensure that MTOE equipment 
will always be ready to meet Army mission requirements. Augmentation will be programmed along with 
other training and operations resources under the staff supervision of DCS, G  –  3/5/7. When ACOM, 
ASCC, and DRU commanders request contract logistic support or ARNG or USAR augmentation, the 
methodology in DA Pam 750  –  1 will be used to compute requirements.  
c.  All commanders will ensure that assigned and/or attached mi litary maintenance personnel are used 
in maintenance operations as outlined in paragraphs 3  –  10 and 3  –  11. 
d.  Resource requirements for maintenance operations to support regular Army and RC installations 
and non -deployable TDA organizations will be programmed and submitted during the PPBE process to 
the appropriate HQDA staff element in accordance with HQDA r esource formulation guidance.
