3–6.  Army maintenance management metrics  
a.  All Army MTOE, TDA, and contract maintenance operations will provide maintenance support within 
the timeframe required by requesting organization commanders. The time required fo r maintenance or-
ganizations to respond to user organization requests for maintenance services will be determined and as-
signed by following the policy on maintenance priorities outlined in paragraph 3  –  4 and DA Pam 7 50  –  1. 
All organizations in the Army will implement a system of metrics by which commanders, leaders, and 
managers will assess the success of maintenance operations for which they are responsible. Metrics, 
mission performance scorecards, and the historica l records that are derived from them will be used as 
objective evidence for implementing operational improvements where necessary and as justification for 
additional resources when required.  
b.  For Army -level maintenance management performance, the primary metrics used at HQDA are lo-
cated in DA Pam 750  –  1. 
c.  Army maintenance organizations will minimize turnaround time ( TAT)  and total logistics response 
time–maintenance ( TLRT  –  M). Command ers will — 
(1)  Manage military maintenance manpower and, when available, contract manpower (in accordance 
with the terms of the contract). Commanders will adhere to manpower utilization standards as described 
in paragr aph 4  –  14 of this regulation. Commanders will use metrics in DA Pam 750  –  1. 
 
(2)  Ensure that shop and bench stocks (combat spares, as applicable) are readily available to support 
maintenance operations.
