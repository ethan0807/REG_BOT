3–4.  Maintenance priorities  
a.  Army maintenance tasks and operations will be conducted in mission priority sequence based on 
the importance of the maintenance work to be done. In the Army's overall logistics management system, 
relevance, and importance are  expressed as urgency of need. Requesting organization commanders will 
determine the appropriate maintenance priority on any work request, based upon the organization’s ur-
gency of need designator ( UND) as prescribed in DA Pam 750  –  1. 
b.  UND is assigne d by the DA G  –  3/5/7 in accordance with the criteria outlined in DA Pam 750  –  1. 
c.  Maintenance units and/or activities manage repair of materiel by maintenance priority designator 
and analysis of impact on unit readiness. The usual sequence of work will be to repair the oldest job with 
the highest priority first. However, analysis of unit materiel readiness may dictate re -sequencing mainte-
nance work.
