13–10. Preparation requirements for DD Form 200
a. Signatures will be entered by pen when DD Form 200 is manually prepared. When DD Form 200 and associated
documents are electronically produced, electronic and/or digital signatures may be used. Final file copies must bemaintained in hard copy.
b. The initiator prepares DD Form 200, block 1 and blocks 3 through 11 per figure 13–4 instructions in paragraph
13–10 d, except when an AR 15–6 investigation is conducted.
(1) When more than one item is lost, damaged, or destroyed, the national stock number (NSN) (block 4), the
quantity (block 6), and unit cost (block 7) will remain blank. Enter “See add page” in the item description (block 5).The total cost (block 8) will be computed by summing together the quantity of each item multiplied by the unit price.If the loss or damage involves more than one item, add you can put one item on the front page but ensure you type seeadded page, the grand total will be placed on the added page in the grand total block (see figs 13–4 and 13–5).
(2) If the loss or damage involves a component, list the component item in block 5 (Item description) and identify
the end item in which it is a component (see fig 13–6).
(3) Unit price (block 7) or on added page will be the price contained in the FEDLOG in effect at the time of the
loss. When a price is not available in FEDLOG, use the current fair market price of a similar item; otherwise, estimatethe price and attach the basis for the estimate to the DD Form 200 as an exhibit. Do not compute the depreciation atthis time; the financial liability officer will compute it in accordance with paragraph 13–32 d(2).

(4) Total cost (block 8) equals the quantity, multiplied by the unit price or the grand summed total of the quantity
times the unit price from the added page when there are multiple items. For damaged property, enter the estimated costto repair the damaged property in parenthesis in block 5, following the description of the damaged property.
(5) Block 9 will contain a description of the events leading to the loss or damage of Government property, with an
explanation of how it happened, when it happened, and who was involved, omitting personal opinions and conjectures.The description will provide enough detail to determine the proximate cause of the loss or damage if possible. Show allpersons directly concerned by name and grade. The description of the facts must be detailed enough to enable theappointing authority or the approving authority to make a determination of whether relief from, or assessment offinancial liability will be sought without appointment of a financial liability officer, or that an investigation by afinancial liability officer is required. The initiator of a DD Form 200 must prepare a thorough document in recognitionthat an investigation by a financial liability officer represents a significant expenditure of time and effort. It may benecessary for the initiator to obtain statements from individuals who were witnesses or who have knowledge of theincident resulting in the loss. If so, the initiator will ensure—

disapprove the findings in blocks 9 and 10 or following an investigation, whether to approve or disapprove thefinancial liability investigating officer’s findings. If an appointing authority is not used, no block is checked.
(b) Comment and/or rationale. The appointing authority determines, upon receipt or following completion of an
investigation, if financial liability should be assessed. When there is no evidence of negligence or willful misconduct,the appointing authority can recommend that all persons be relieved of financial liability. If the appointing authoritycan establish from information in blocks 9 through 10 and the attached exhibits that negligence or willful misconductwas the proximate cause of loss or damage, and a financial liability investigating officer is not used, the appointingauthority must perform specific actions that the financial liability investigating officer would have done (see para13–23). Following an investigation, the appointing authority enters his or her rationale, to justify the checked approvedor disapproved in block 13a.

If an investigating officer is required, the approving authority completes amemorandum appointing the financial liability investigating officer or AR 15–6 investigating officer (see fig 13–12).Following the completion of the investigation or if no further investigation is required, the approving authoritycompletes blocks 14a-h.
(a) Recommendation (X one).1. Approve.
2. Disapprove.

I relieve all concerned from financial liability for the property listed in blocks 4through 6.” If the approving authority makes a determination that the investigation is incomplete or finds pertinentinstructions have not been completed, the approving authority will return the DD Form 200 to the investigating officerthrough the appointing authority. If one is designated, or they relieve the financial liability investigating officer theymust appoint a new financial liability investigating officer.
2. When the approving authority determines the financial liability investigation is complete, the approving authority
will adopt the recommendations of the financial liability investigating officer or appointing authority by checking theapprove box in block 14a and complete blocks 14b through 14h; or make a decision contrary to the financial liabilityinvestigating officer or appointing authority’s findings by checking the disapprove box in 14a and either relieving allconcerned from financial liability or assessing financial liability against a new individual.

they will enter the following statements “All concerned are relieved from financial liability of the property listed onthis financial liability investigation of property loss.” The approving authority will clearly state the mitigating circum-stances that justify waiving any or all financial liability in the comments and/or rationale (block 14b) or on a separatememorandum for record. If a separate memorandum is used, add the statement, “See separate memorandum forrationale of financial liability waiver” in block 14b.
4. If the approving authority believes that financial liability is appropriate, they will obtain a legal opinion as to its
legal sufficiency prior to determining whether to assess financial liability.
5. When the approving authority decides to approve charges of financial liability against an individual, the approv-
ing authority will enter “Approved to hold (insert name, rank, and SSN) financially liable in the amount entered inblock 15d.” Also enter the respondent’s basic pay at the time of loss or damage.
6. If the approving authority determines that it appears appropriate to approve financial liability against an individual
not previously recommended for assessment of financial liability, the approving authority will ensure that all actionsrequired by paragraphs 13–34 and 13–35 are completed prior to assessing financial liability and enter the reason forapproving financial liability.

provide records in which to ensure proper custody was maintained. The circumstances in block 9 shows that CPT Doefailed to keep any records of equipment as it was issued or hand receipted to the users or supervisors. In fact, there isnot a single valid sub hand receipt for any property. He failed to ensure that these records were maintained by anyone.Although CPT Doe had a great amount of supply personnel turbulence during his command, the onerous of the failureto keep any hand receipts lies with him along. He never asked nor did he seek to see the company’s or supervisor’shand receipts. If he knew the fact that no hand receipts were kept, he did nothing to rectify the issue. He had manychances to fix his problem during cyclic inventories and command inspections. The loss of this equipment was caused
by this lack of records. Recommend that CPT Doe be held liable for the loss of the equipment which totaled $ 34,834.

equipment records. This one act ultimately ended in the loss of equipment because the equipment was issued andforgotten. CPT Doe’s rebuttal gave no further evidence to show who the equipment was issued or hand receipted to.Approved to hold CPT Doe, SSN, financially liable for the amount of $ 4,149.30. CPT Doe’s monthly base pay is$ 4,149.30. (See WAH8AA–14–FA–055.)
