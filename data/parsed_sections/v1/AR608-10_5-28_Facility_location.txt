 –  28.  Facility location  
a.  Consideration should be given to locating centers within or convenient to installation housing areas when possible. 
CDS facilities must be located away from safety hazards and areas of heavy vehicular traffic. Parking and drop off areas 
must be available so that children and parents can enter and leave th e building without crossing a thoroughfare or walking 
through large parking lots.  
b.  Installations requiring extensive CDS should provide multiple facilities on dispersed sites readily accessible to both 
on and off post patrons. Multiple facilities on sin gle sites should be avoided whenever possible. Placement of multiple  

 facilities on a single site requires written approval from USACFSC (CFSC  –  SF  –  CY) prior to initiation of the design pro-
cess.  
c.  Siting for all proposed facilities requires the concurre nce of the Installation Planning Board (AR 210  –  20). The Board 
must request siting approval from MACOM well in advance of design approval and construction.
