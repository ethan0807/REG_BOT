Commercial warehouses are employed either to store certain property en route to water terminals or awaiting other
overseas shipment or to provide more storage capacity for depots. In the former case, when a DD Form 200 is neededfor a transportation discrepancy in a shipment received by a commercial warehouse, the terminal agency that maintainsthe files on shipping documents covering property stored at a certain warehouse is responsible for its preparation. Inthe latter case, the officer accountable for the property (the depot accountable officer of the accountable supplydistribution activity) will prepare such a DD Form 200 covering the transportation discrepancies in shipments receivedat a warehouse. The officer or activity depends on the warehouse for pertinent data required for its preparation.
