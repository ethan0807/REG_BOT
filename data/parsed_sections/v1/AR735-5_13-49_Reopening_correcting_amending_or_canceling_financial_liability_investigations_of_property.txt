13–49. Reopening, correcting, amending, or canceling financial liability investigations of property
loss
These are administrative procedures. They may be activated by either—
a. A decision at the approval authority level previously acting on the DD Form 200 that such action is necessary.
b. At the direction of the appeal authority.
c. The financial liability investigation approving authority will reopen a DD Form 200 when either of the situations
shown in paragraph 13–49 a and paragraph 13–49 b occur and result from one of the following actions:
(1) An individual has requested reconsideration of the assessment of financial liability.(2) A response to the financial liability officer’s original notification from an individual recommended for assess-
ment of financial liability is received after the approving authority has approved financial liability. The financialliability officer who receives such a correspondence, will prepare a memorandum as discussed in paragraph 13–35 b(7)
to the approving authority level that approved financial liability. Such a response, although received late, will not be
considered a request for reconsideration.
(3) A memorandum from a subordinate headquarters that previously acted on a financial liability investigation
supporting reopening based on new evidence.
(4) Property is recovered.(5) The approving authority becomes aware of an injustice against either the Government or the individual assessed
financial liability.
