a.  Unauthorized child care is prohibited in Government owned or leased housing or in family housing located on the 
installation except as authorized by this regulation. The provision of FCC in Government owned or leased housing or 
privately owned family housing units located on the installation is a privilege extended to family members. Only the best qualified among applicants who meet minimum standards will be certified.  
b.  Certification as a FCC provider is not required for an individual who provides child care on an Army installation, or 
off an Army installation in Government owned or leased housing under Army control, when such care is provided in another person’s quarters to children who reside in those quarters and no additional children are present in those quarters 
except the children of the individual providing care.  
c.  FCC homes may not be authorized unless sufficient  professional personnel are provided to recruit FCC providers, 
and certify and monitor individual FCC providers and homes in accordance with this regulation. Only FCC systems which meet this criteria may certify FCC providers.
