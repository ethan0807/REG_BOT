200:
(1) Upon review of DD Form 200 and attached exhibits by the approving authority or appointing authority, as
appropriate, a decision is made that an AR 15–6 investigation will be initiated to investigate the loss. The decisionwhether to appoint an AR 15–6 investigating officer is reflected on DD Form 200, block 13c, as shown in figure 13–18An AR 15–6 investigating officer is appointed using a memorandum of appointment per the AR 15-6, paragraph 2–1 b.

200 is initiated using the instructions in paragraphs 13–10 c and 13–10 d.
c. On completion of the AR 15–6 investigation:
(1) Attach the AR 15–6 investigation to DD Form 200 as an exhibit. Do not use the AR 15–6 investigation as a
supporting document or voucher to adjust balances on property records or as a document to assess financial liability.Use DD Form 200 for these purposes.

recommended, the AR 15–6 investigating officer will complete block 15b through block 16h. The appointing authorityor the approving authority as appropriate will accomplish any actions not performed by the AR 15–6 investigatingofficer or normally required of a financial liability officer, such as notifying the individual being charged, as prescribedin paragraph 13–32, paragraph 13–34, and paragraph 13–35, had once been appointed.
