12â€“6.  Reliability -centered maintenance, condition based maintenance, and remote diagnostic 
assessment  
a.  All organizations and activities that are responsible to plan for acquisition of equipment used in the 
medical environment are responsible t o address and comply to the extent possible, with the following ele-
ments:  
(1)  Application of the RCM process from inception of the requirement, during acquisition, and develop-
ment of maintenance support strategies, to procurement, and deployment, leads t o a maintenance pro-
gram that uses the limited resources of parts and personnel effectively to limit equipment downtime and 
failure on critical items while allowing tolerable risk on systems that are not as critical.  
(2)  RCM is the foundation for CBM/ PPMx. The incorporation of diagnostic and prognostic systems of 
CBM/ PPMx into the equipment creates a shift from performing scheduled services to an analytical pro-
cess that discloses degradation of product performance before failure.  
(3)  Research, develop ment, and acquisition is a program and capability that allows remote access, in-
terrogation and corrective actions to medical devices and equipment via internet protocol or by direct con-
nection to on -the-ground diagnostic equipment.  
b.  These capabilities a re described collectively as a single logistics operational environment under the 
Common Logistics Operating Environment Program.
