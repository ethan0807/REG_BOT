16–24. Step 3–Inactivated installations
Normally, financial liability investigations of property loss involving discrepancies in shipments process before
inactivation of an installation and its records are retired to a records holding area. However, notice arrives sometimesafter the inactivation. This happens most often for shipments to agencies outside the Army (see paras 16–10, 16–21,and 16–22). In such instances, the headquarters that exercised command jurisdiction over the installation before itsinactivation will prepare and process the necessary financial liability investigations of property loss from data obtainedfrom the proper records holding area.
