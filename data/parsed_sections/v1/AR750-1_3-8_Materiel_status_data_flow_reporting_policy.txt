3–8.  Materiel status data flow reporting policy  
a.  This paragraph establishes and standardizes the materiel condition status report flow, Enterprise 
Materiel Status Reporting ( EMS R), defining the reporting architecture, and identifies the responsibilities 
for materiel status file transfers to AMC. Daily/weekly/monthly maintenance/readiness data will be elec-
tronically submitted to AMC to ensure readiness reports are available for all Army stakeholders that rely 
on readiness information.  
b.  All Army agencies, CLS, and activities performing maintenance on Army equipment are responsible 
for reporting maintenance and readiness information to AMC, following procedures in DA Pam 750  –  1. 
c.  Maintenance, logistics, and readiness managers will obtain required access to enterprise systems to 
view readiness data/reports reported through the EMSR.  
d.  Aviation units will adhere to the requ irements in this policy using procedures in DA Pam 750  –  1. 
e.  Readiness reporting at the lowest level (derivative) makes maintenance/readiness reporting within 
the modular force a plug -and-play capability consistent with modular force redesign policy. I n the event 
GCSS -Army lacks an automated readiness reporting capability through EMSR for a particular system or 
fleet (that is, APS Fleets and certain Aviation equipment), AMC will provide guidance on reporting equip-
ment readiness directly into the AES IP Portal. Any exception to this policy will be granted on a case by 
case basis and only with the approval of DCS, G  –  4.
