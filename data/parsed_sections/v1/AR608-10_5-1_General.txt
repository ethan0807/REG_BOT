a.  Chapters  1 through 4 of this regulation apply to the CDC system with the exception of statements referring specifi-
cally to FCC homes or SPS delivery systems.  
b.  The CDC system offers child care programs within centralized installation facilities, or parts of facilities, used  ex-
clusively for this purpose.  
c.  CDC programs provide quality group care that is affordable, convenient to the work site, and readily accessible to 
all military families. Centralized programs are often preferred by parents because they offer comprehensiv e services to 
include a mixture of program types and homogeneous child –age group categories for ages 6 weeks through 12 years. 
Parents are assured that their child is receiving quality supervised care given by trained caregiving employees.  
d.  CDC programs support Service families with working spouses; those families who need short term hourly care for 
respite, volunteer work, or recreational purposes; and those who need regularly scheduled part –day services.
