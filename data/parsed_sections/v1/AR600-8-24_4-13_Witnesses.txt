To the maximum extent possible, the respondent has the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him or her.  
a.  The personal appearance of witnesses should be obtained whenever practicable in preference to the use of dep-
ositions, affidavits, or written statements. Accordingly, such requests will be honored by the board if the requested 
witness is considered reasonably available and testimony will add materially to the case. Requests for witnesses will 
include a statement specifying the substance of expected testimony.   

 b.  The president of the B oard of Inquiry will request the commander or government agency to order witnesses to 
appear as witnesses for the Government that are members of the Armed Forces or civilian employees of the Govern-
ment. The availability of the witness is determined by the appropriate commander. If the commander determines that 
a requested witness is not reasonably available, the reasons will be furnished to the president of the board, who will 
have this determination appended to the record of proceedings.  
c.  Military members and civilian employees of the Army, called as witnesses on behalf of the Government and 
required to travel are entitled to temporary duty allowance as prescribed in the JTR and DFAS  –  IN Regulation 37  –  1, 
Chapter 10. Other witnesses requested by t he respondent will not be reimbursed for expenses relating to their appear-
ance unless they qualify for invitational travel orders under the JTR.  
d.  Witnesses appearing before the board will be sworn.  
e.  Boards of Inquiry may call witnesses on their own m otion.
