All documents that show the acquisition, issue, or disposition of real property willbe recorded in a voucher register. This register will be retained by the real property accountable officer to supportchanges to real property records, per AR 405–45. Audit trails must be kept-that is, DD Form 1354 (Transfer andAcceptance of DOD Real Property), DA Form 337 (Request for Approval of Disposal of Buildings and Improvements),contracts, work orders, and drawings. Copies of DD Form 1354 will be kept for the life of the facility plus 10 years.

accounts in the installation’s general ledger. Summary or detail posting documents will be provided to the FAO by thefacility engineer. As a minimum, the ledger accounts will include land, buildings, structures and linear structures.
c. Inventory. Real property general property and equipment and stewardship land will be inventoried at least once
every 5 years. Real property heritage assets will be inventoried at least once every 3 years or upon change of theaccountable officer, whichever comes first per AR 405–45. The results will be reconciled with the accounting records.
