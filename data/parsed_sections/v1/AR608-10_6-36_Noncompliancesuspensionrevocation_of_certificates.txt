6  –  36.  Noncompliance/suspension/revocation of certificates  
a.  Each installation will develop an SOP that describes the procedures for noncompliance with regulatory requirements 
as well as plans fo r suspension/revocation.  
b.  Suspension or revocation decisions will be made by the installation commander upon the recommendation of the 
CDS coordinator. Immediate suspension of the FCC home certification will occur if the FCC provider’s failure to comply  
with the regulatory requirements results in an emergency situation that endangers life, health, or safety of children in care , 
and in cases of suspected child abuse. The certification document and home identification card will be returned to and 
retained by the FCC director during the period of suspension or upon revocation. The installation commander will close a 
FCC home when a life threatening situation exists, when there is reason to believe a child is at risk if the FCC home remains open or when adult  occupants of an FCC home unreasonably deny admission to CDS management personnel.
