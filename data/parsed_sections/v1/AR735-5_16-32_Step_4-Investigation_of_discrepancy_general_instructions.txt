16–32. Step 4–Investigation of discrepancy general instructions
The instructions contained in chapter 13 for review of financial liability investigations of property loss by appointing
and approving authority and investigation by financial liability officers do not fully apply to processing the DD Form361 for financial liability investigation purposes. This is true because based on the DD Form 361; the functions of boththe appointing authority and installation commander are discharged by the appointing and approving authority. Also,investigations are made as an adjunct of the appointing and approving authority action rather than by formallydesignating a financial liability officer.
