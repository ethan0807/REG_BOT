5–20.  Bill of material for materiel requirements planning  
a.  A BOM  is the formally structured list of basic parts and materiel contained in equipment weapon 
systems, their components and/or assemblies, depending on the type of BOM. The primary purpose or 
function of a BOM, in the maintenance sustainment process, is to provide the official basis to identify and 
determine material requirements and shortages (planned or actual) as a result of the materiel require-
ments planning ( MRP). The MRP process works to ensure the correct repair parts and components are 
identified and available to meet the maintenance, repair, overhaul, or fabrication schedule while 
 
maintaining the lowest possible level of materiel on hand. LCMCs are to ensure that current BOM and 
other updated te chnical and/or engineering data are the basis for MRP and long -term decision -making in 
support of depot maintenance work request ( DMWR) and WBS actions.
