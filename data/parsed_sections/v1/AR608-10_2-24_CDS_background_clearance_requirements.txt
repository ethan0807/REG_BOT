a.  Records screening procedures.   All CDS employee applicants, youth applicants, FCC providers, FCC substitute pr o-
viders, Family members ages 12 and older, other authorized individuals residing in the potential FCC home, and CDS 
volunteer applicants (including foster grandparents with exception noted in paragraph  3–15i), and employees and volun-
teers in chapel settings (as noted in paragraph  1–5e) will be screened by submitting their names to the agencies listed in 
table  2  –  1 for a check of prior instances of reported mis conduct. If an FCC substitute provider is limited to only providing  

 care in the regular provider’s home, the substitute provider’s family members over the age of 12 are exempt from the 
background check. A background check is required. It is based on a set of the employees fingerprints and other identifying 
information and then processed through the Identification Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigations and the State 
Criminal History Repositories (SCHR) of all States that an employee or prospective employee lists as current and former 
residences for five years prior to hire. Appropriate release forms signed by the individual or sponsor must accompany the 
screening requests. Screening requests for ADAPCP records must be accompanied by a signed DA Form  5018R (ADAPCP 
Client Consent Statement for Release of Treatment Information). (AR 600  –  85 Chapter  6) See Appendix C, Single Source 
Criteria, for additional guidance on background clearance requirements).
