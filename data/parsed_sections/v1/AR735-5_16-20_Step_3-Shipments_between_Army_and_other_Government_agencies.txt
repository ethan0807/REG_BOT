16–20. Step 3–Shipments between Army and other Government agencies
On discovery of a transportation discrepancy (except inconsequential) in a shipment received from another Government
agency, the TO initiates a DD Form 361 for financial liability investigation purposes. The initiation of the DD Form361 at the Army installation receiving the shipment occurs regardless of whether or not the shipment moved on a DABL or on one from another Government agency.
