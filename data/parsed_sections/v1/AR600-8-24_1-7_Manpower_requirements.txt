Manpower requirements for the officer transfer and discharge functions will be determined by the appropriate require-
ments procedures process. Requirements for table of distribution and allowances (TDA) organizations are determined 
by the Manpower Staffing Standard System and Manpower Surveys. Requirements for table of organization and 
equipment (TOE) and modification table of organization and equipment (MTOE) are determined by manpower re-
quirements criteria. The peacetime mission availability factor provides the link between TDA and TOE/MTOE or-
ganizations.
