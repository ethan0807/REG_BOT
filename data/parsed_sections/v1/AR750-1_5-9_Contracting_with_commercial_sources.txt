The negotiating, awarding, funding, and managing of national maintenance contracts are normally the re-
sponsibility of AMC. Included are mandatory (proprietary) type contracts and contracts for workload be-
yond the core workloads required  in organic depots. However, a depot is permitted to negotiate, award, 
and administer a maintenance contract in those instances where the services of a contractor are needed 
to support the completion of an authorized in -house job order and to surge to meet  emerging contingency 
requirements.
