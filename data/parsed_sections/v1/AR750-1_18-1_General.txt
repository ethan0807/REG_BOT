18–1.  General  
a.  Advanced manufacturing refers to new ways to manufacture existing products and the manufacture 
of new products resulting from advances in technology. Advanced ma nufacturing depends on use and 
coordination of information, automation, computation, software, sensing, and networking, and making use 
of cutting -edge materials and emerging capabilities enabled by the physical and biological sciences. Ad-
vanced manufacturi ng includes, but is not limited to, additive manufacturing (also known as three -dimen-
sional (3D) printing).  
b.  The objective of this policy is to promote the Army’s use of additive manufacturing technologies for 
supporting and improving readiness and enab ling unit capability to solve problems while minimizing risk 
to Soldiers, mission, and materiel.  
c.  The guidance in this regulation is for maintenance activities and not intended to apply to other uses 
the commander may have.  
d.  Use of additive manufactu ring is applicable for items which authority exists for local fabrication and 
for items developed through unit innovation.  
e.  Additive manufacturing refers to manufacturing or fabrication processes that involve the joining of 
materials to make objects fro m three -dimensional model data, usually layer upon layer. Examples of 
available additive manufacturing technologies are 3D printing, powder bed fusion, and cold spray.  
f.  Additive manufacturing technologies provide a unique and flexible expeditionary capa bility for return-
ing equipment to a mission capable status during BDAR, returning NMC equipment to a ready status, 
overcoming issues of parts obsolescence or responding to disruptions in the supply system.  
g.  The policies in this chapter apply to operat ional (field) units and activities.  
h.  For procedures relating to additive manufacturing see DA Pam 750  –  1 and the Additive Manufactur-
ing Guidebook.
