14–25. Leased property
An AR 15–6 investigation may be used instead of a DD Form 200 for losses of leased property when negligence or
willful misconduct is suspected. However, when the investigation finds negligence or willful misconduct exists, the AR15–6 investigation will be attached to a DD Form 200 as discussed in paragraph 13–25.
