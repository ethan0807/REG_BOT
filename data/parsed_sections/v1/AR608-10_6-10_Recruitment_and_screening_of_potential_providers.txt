Potential FCC provider applicants will attend an FCC orientation session and will be interviewed by F CC management 
personnel prior to beginning the formal FCC certification process.

describe the overall program requirements and the cert ification process.

the individual formally beginning the certification process. This interview will be conducted at a time when the entir e 
family is present to allow observation of family dynamics.  
(1)  FCC management personnel will use a standard interview format which includes questions related to FCC provider 
caregiving and administrative responsibilities to determine the individual’s ge neral knowledge and aptitude for child care.  
(2)  Written records of screening interviews will be kept in appropriate files.  
c.  The results of the screening interview, background checks, personal reference checks and contributing factors pre-
sented by the family members will be used to determine suitability for acceptance into the FCC program. Results of these 
may be used to deny an application.
