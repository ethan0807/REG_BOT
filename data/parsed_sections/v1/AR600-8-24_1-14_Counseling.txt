a.  When a commissioned officer or warrant officer (except for chaplains, judge advocates, and Army Medical 
Department (AMEDD) personnel) with less than 10 years active federal commissioned service (AFCS) submits a 
request for a voluntary REFRAD under chapter  2 or an unqualified resignation under chapter  3 of this regulation, the 
first colonel in the officer’s chain of command or supervision will counsel the officer. Judge advocates, chaplains, and 
AMEDD officers will be counseled by a senior officer of their branch in the chain of technical supervision or as 
specifically designated by their branch. If the officer is an RC officer on the active duty list (ADL) or an AGR officer,
