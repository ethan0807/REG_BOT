All proposals for cont ract maintenance support of classified COMSEC and/or signals intelligence

rity prior to using commercial maintenance sources. The National Security Agency  (NSA) must conduct 
this special risk assessment. The proposal, including PWS with additional information identifying the 
COMSEC and/or SIGINT and EW equipment, density supported, and levels of maintenance to be per-
formed, should be submitted through DCS, G  –  3/5/7 (DAMO  –  C4T), 400 Army Pentagon, Washington, DC 
20310  –  0400, to Director, NSA (S  –  04), Fort Meade, MD 20755  –  6000. Classified equipment not under 
NSA cognizance being considered for maintenance support contracts to contractors other than OEMs will 
be given an assessment of risk as prescribed above. Approval by HQDA is required prior to contract 
 
award. In the event of approval from NSA and/or HQDA, then the provisions of chapter 4  apply to further 
processing.
