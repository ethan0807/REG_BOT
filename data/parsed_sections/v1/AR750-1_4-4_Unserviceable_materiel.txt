4–4.  Unserviceable materiel  
a.  Unserviceable end items that cannot be repaired at field level may be repaired by a local sustain-
ment below -depot activity when such capability and capacity is authorized on a reimbursable repair and 
return basis. If no such capability exists or is insufficient to the requirement, then the item/s must be 
turned in to a depot  or PM’s repair activity through the appropriate SSA as a supply transaction, thus re-
moved from unit property record. Exceptions to this are for critical medical equipment, COMPO 2 and 3 
equipment undergoing depot or PM’s repair activity sustainment le vel actions. COMPO 2 and 3 equip-
ment unless directed otherwise by HQDA, will remain on COMPO 2 and 3 property records in order to 
meet the provisions of DoDI 1225.06.  
b.  Field and sustainment maintenance units are authorized to provide lateral support to other units 
when maintenance requirements exceed capabilities.  
c.  Materiel will be protected (packaged and/or crated) to prevent further damage during transfer and/or 
turn-in. This may include all BII and COEI.
