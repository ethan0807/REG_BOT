6  –  30.  Developmental programming requirements  
FCC homes provide unique opportunities for children to learn and grow at their own pace.  
a.  In a FCC home much learning takes place through child observation and  participation in normal home routines such 
as, sorting laundry, cooking, simple repairs and maintenance. FCC providers should use daily routines such as eating, 
washing, toileting, and napping as the framework for organizing the day. Structuring the day i n this manner will give the 
child a sense of competency by understanding what is going to happen as the day progresses.  
b.  The daily schedule for children, though informal, should provide some consistency to encourage feelings of stability 
and security. W hen planning daily program activities and routines, the FCC provider will consider — 
(1)  The age and developmental level of the children.  
(2)  The needs of individual children.  
(3)  The experiences offered children in their own homes.  
(4)  The goals that children’s families have for them.  
c.  Daily activities modeled on the FCC provider sample developmental activity schedule completed during the certifi-
cation process will include — 
(1)  Routines such as meals, snacks, and rest periods which follow a familia r and consistent pattern.  
(2)  Opportunities to “help” the FCC provider with simple household chores.  
(3)  Stories, music, dancing, and singing with children.  
(4)  Listening and talking opportunities.  
(5)  Creative activities such as water play, cutting an d pasting, painting, coloring, dramatic play and blocks.  
(6)  Outdoor activities such as neighborhood walks and gardening.  
d.  Each provider should, with the assistance of the TACS, prepare a weekly activity plan which is based on the devel-
opmental levels of children in care.  
e.  The TACS should provide a monthly activity guide for all providers which includes ways to use the home environ-
ment in developmental programming for FCC children. This guide should offer low –cost ideas for activities and equipment 
and should include guidance for working with a group of multi –age children.
