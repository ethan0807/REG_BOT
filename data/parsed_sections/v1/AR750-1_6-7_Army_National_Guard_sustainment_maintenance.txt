Aircraft that require unscheduled or urgent sustainment repair will be reported to ARNG. Aircraft will be 
selected for recapitalization or susta inment repair based on rebuild induction criteria or when estimated 
cost of repair exceeds FLM capability. When aircraft RCFs are available at the NICP, the aircraft will be 
scheduled on an exchange basis. When RCF is not resourced, aircraft will be re paired and returned to 
the owning ARNG unit.
