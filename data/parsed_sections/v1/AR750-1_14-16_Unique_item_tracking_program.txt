14–16.  Unique item tracking program  
a.  The objective of the UIT Program is to maintain visibility of each uniquely identified a sset for the pri-
mary purpose of inventory control and/or engineering analysis. Security, accountability, safety, mainte-
nance, OR, warranty applicability, and other areas that may benefit from the tracking process will be sub-
sets of the inventory control o r engineering analysis functions. UIT by serial number of selected items and 
installed components is required by Defense Logistics Manual 4000.25  –  2 Volume 2, DoDI 4140.07, and 
AR 710  –  3. 
b.  UIT reporting requirements for Army -controlled small arms,  security risk I nonnuclear missiles and 
rockets, CCIs, and radiological testing and tracking assets are set forth in AR 710  –  3. Additional assets for 
which serial number tracking via UIT is deemed necessary will be approved by the DCS, G  –  4 (Mainte-
nance Directorate).  
c.  All assets within the supply system subject to UIT will be tagged with a UII that specifically identifies 
individual assets being controlled or managed. A UII can be the item’s serial number, and the vehicle 
identification number,  if no other UIT asset has the same identifier within the NSN or NIIN. Installed com-
ponents, as specified in AR 710  –  3, also require UII assignment.  
d.  All UIT programs will include provisions for data entry and tracking using AIT. In that regard,  
MATDEVs will ensure that new procurements of serial -number -tracked assets include provisions for AIT-
readable serial number markings to be applied during manufacture.
