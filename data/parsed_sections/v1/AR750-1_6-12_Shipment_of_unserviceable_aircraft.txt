6–12.  Shipment of unserviceable aircraft  
Unserviceable items selected for disposal by AMCOM will not be reinstalled in an aircraft. Action will be 
taken to ensure that the airframe attaching elements of the removed items are protected from deteriora-
tion or contamination while awaiting the replacement item. However, if the unserviceable aircraft is to be 
shipped or transferred off post or off station for repair, the unserviceable or interchangeable item must be 
 
installed or completely secured to prevent possible damage, deterioration, or contamination during move-
ment of the aircraft. All unserviceable components will be individually tagged with DD Form 1577  –  2 and 
suitable entries made in the aircraft equipment records.
