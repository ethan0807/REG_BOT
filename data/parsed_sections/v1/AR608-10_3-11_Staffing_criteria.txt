large installations.  
g.  The CDS coordinator may dual function as a system director (e.g., CDC, FCC or SPS) when the total CDS ADA is 
less than 100. 
h.  CDS management personnel at small installations may dual function positions or work part –time when workload 
does not meet the yardstick for a single full– time position (i.e., TACS and SAS coordinator, SPS director and FCC director, 
SPS director/CDS coordinator).  
i.  CDS management personnel may not triple funct ion positions except at very small installations where total child 
enrollment is 75 or less.  
j.  Positions not suitable for dual or triple functioning due to overlapping periods of program operation include — 
(1)  SAS specialist and SPS director.

(3)  CDC director and FCC director.  
(4)  CDS coordinator and CDC director when there are other CDS delivery systems.  
k.  Two part –time positions may be preferable to dual functioning a single position.
