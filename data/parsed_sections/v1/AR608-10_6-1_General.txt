a.  Chapters  1 through 4 of this regulation apply to the FCC system with the exception of statements referring specifi-
cally to other delivery systems i.e., CDCs or SPS.  
b.  The FCC system offers qua rters–based child care provided by authorized military family members operating as in-
dependent contractors from housing located on a military installation or from U.S. Government owned or leased housing  

 off the installation. This care is regulated by the U .S. Army and both the individual providing services (FCC provider) and 
the occupied housing unit (FCC home) will be certified by CDS before children may be enrolled in care.  
c.  FCC is a cost effective child care delivery system which allows provision of child care without large expenditures 
for facilities. FCC reduces the burden on center –based programs by providing 24– hour and long –term care during mobi-
lization and training exercises, extended care for special needs children, and care for mildly ill and n ewborn infants. In 
addition, the FCC delivery system provides employment opportunities for thousands of military spouses.  
d.  Providers who care for children of military and DOD civilian personnel are eligible to receive direct and indirect 
subsidies.  
e.  The FCC program is a service to DOD military and civilian personnel and will not generate NAF income.
