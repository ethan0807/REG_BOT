14–20.  Army Corrosion Prevention and Control Program  
a.  The Army CPC Program responsibilities and guidance are in accordance with AR 750  –  59. 
b.  CPC  is a critical consideration in assuring the sustained performance, readiness, economical opera-
tion, and service life of Army systems and equipment. It requires active consideration in the materiel de-
velopment, acquisition, fielding, operation, and storage  processes. CPC requires life cycle management 
planning and action in design, development, testing, fielding, training, and maintenance.  
c.  CPC will be achieved by incorporation of the latest state -of-the-art corrosion control technology in 
the original  equipment design, in the manufacturing, in all levels of maintenance, in supply, and in the 
storage processes. The objective is to minimize corrosion by using design and manufacturing practices 
that address selection of materials; coatings and surface tre atments; production processes; process 
specifications; system geometry; material limitations; environmental extremes; storage and ready condi-
tions; preservation and packaging requirements; and repairs, overhaul, and spare parts requirements.
