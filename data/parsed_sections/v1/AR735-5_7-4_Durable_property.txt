accountability but, because of its unique characteristics, requires control when issued to the user. The following classesor types of property will be coded durable and responsibility assigned as follows:

When the unit of issue contains more than one item (such as,package, box, and dozen) and the cost of a single item (unit of measurement) is less than $50, the entire set will betreated as an expendable item at the user level, even though it may be coded as durable in FEDLOG.
