a.  All CDS personnel, will be in good health as evidenced by the pre -employment physical. Add itionally, a determina-
tion must be made as to whether these individuals, as well as persons residing in FCC homes, have any communicable diseases. Where the health of any child is at risk, the parents/guardians will be notified. The question of whether or not a  

 disease is communicable is a medical decision made by a physician after careful consideration of the presence or absence 
of conditions necessary for the transmission of the disease. Any action involving the hiring, firing, or other condition or 
privi lege of employment, certification or decertification, involving individuals who have a communicable disease should 
be made by CDS management personnel after consultation with medical professionals, and where applicable, the installa-
tion civilian personnel office employee relations branch. Before taking such action, the following factors should be con-
sidered:  
(1)  How the disease is transmitted.  
(2)  The duration of the risk.  
(3)  The severity of the risk.  
(4)  The probability of the transmission of the disease causing harm.  
b.  If CDS personnel are found to have a communicable disease, consideration must be given to providing reasonable 
accommodation for this condition, such as by reassigning the affected employee to an administrative position where chil-
dren and other personnel are not at risk or closing an FCC home. When FCC certification must be temporarily suspended to prevent the spread of a communicable disease, CDS management personnel will make arrangements for alternative care 
for the children. FC C certification will be delayed, denied, or suspended until there is no health risk to the children.  
c.  All CDS personnel will have a medical assessment before employment or certification. This evaluation will include 
a tuberculin skin test or chest X –ray, and other tests deemed appropriate by the occupational health service. Testing for 
susceptibility to and vaccination against rubella is strongly recommended. Requirements for immunization against other 
vaccine preventable disease and other significant di seases among caregiving employees, FCC providers and children 
should be considered by the occupational health service staff and health consultant. Documentation will be maintained in 
the personnel file of the program to which the individual is assigned.  
d.  Personnel must be able to walk, bend, stoop, and stand for prolonged periods. They must also be able to lift 40 
pounds.  
e.  Health requirements for regularly scheduled CDS volunteers will be locally determined.
