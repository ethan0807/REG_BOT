a. When Government quarters or the Government furnishings and equipment contained therein become lost, dam-
aged, or destroyed, the installation housing manager will initiate a DD Form 200. The DD Form 200 will be processedthrough the chain of command of the individual who is signed for the quarters at the time of the incident per paragraph13–5. Military and civilian sponsors may be charged with financial liability when the loss or damage is the result of
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the sponsor, whether or not the sponsor has receipted for the quarters,
furnishings, or equipment. This also includes cases where the loss or damage results from an act of a householdmember or guest, or a pet of either the household member or guest. However, it does not include losses resulting fromfair wear and tear, or an act of God.

who actually caused the loss or damage. In this instance, upon assessing financial liability, the DD Form 200 will beforwarded to the servicing claims office for collection.
c. When a DD Form 200 is initiated to account for the loss or damage of Government quarters and/or the
Government furnishings and equipment contained therein, a determination of gross negligence will result in the fullamount of the loss to the Government being assessed against the sponsor.
