8–14.  Army Warranty Program for information technology  
a.  Items for Army use should be acquired with warranties only when the warranty is in the Army’s best 
interest. The decision must be made case by case. Acquiring commands or activiti es will establish local 
warranty implementation procedures (see AR 700  –  139).  
b.  In warranty applications, unit readiness and mission effectiveness will take priority. If the FLM activ-
ity is not able to get an effective response (within the warranty -specified timeframes), the maintenance 
activity will contact the acquiring command or activity for resolution. When resolution is not timely enough 
to meet mission requirements, the maintenance activity commander may authorize repair of the item and 
will not ify the acquiring command or activity in writing of the necessity to repair the item now and settle 
any warranty issues later.  
c.  To the greatest extent possible, IT warranties will be structured to allow onsite or mail -in processes 
to maintain their war ranties. FRAs are authorized at the AMC LCMC commander’s discretion to facilitate 
logistics IT repairs by the warranty vendors. FRAs should take action to become OEM certified warranty 
providers. Field maintenance will be performed on automation syst ems hardware when it does not violate 
the warranty.  
 
d.  Warranty support, which is contracted for prior to IOC but occurs after IOC, will be counted as depot 
maintenance and repair when reporting under the 50/50 rule. However, warranty support that is con-
tracted for and occurs prior to IOC will not be counted as depot maintenance and repair when reporting 
under the 50/50 rule.
