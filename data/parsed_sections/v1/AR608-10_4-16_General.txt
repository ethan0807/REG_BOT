(2)  Children are encouraged to solve problems, initiate activities, explore, experiment, question and gain mastery, 
through learning by doing.  
(3)  Curriculum planning emphasizes learning as an interactive, integrated process.  
(4)  Learning activities and materials are concrete, real, and relevant to the lives of children.  
(5)  Workbooks, worksheets, dittos, coloring books  and adult –made models of art projects for young children to copy 
will not be used.  
(6)  Language understanding and use is fostered in an atmosphere which encourages easy communication among chil-
dren and between children and adults.  
(7)  The 13 functional areas as outlined in the National Child Development Associate (CDA) competencies will provide 
a framework for determining the skill level of caregiving employees and FCC providers.  
c.  Developmental programming is identified and characterized by the follow ing: child/family orientation; supportive 
management policies and procedures; appropriate resource allocation and use (i.e., space, time, equipment, materials, and 
personnel); and recognition of unique age group requirements.
