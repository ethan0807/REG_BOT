11–1. General information
This chapter contains concepts and guidelines for establishing and maintaining the CSDP. The CSDP addresses
supervisory or managerial responsibilities within the supply system from the user to the ACOM, ASCC, and/or DRUlevel. AR 710–2 outlines the specific requirements for the CSDP.
a. The CSDP is a compilation of existing regulatory requirements brought together for visibility purposes. It is
directed at standardizing supply discipline throughout the Army. Also, the CSDP is meant to simplify command,supervisory, and managerial responsibilities. Simplification is accomplished by outlining the various requirements forresponsible personnel, by standardizing requirements, and by formalizing follow-up procedures.
b. The CSDP is a commander’s program. Brigade and battalion commanders will implement the CSDP using
existing resources. Examples of existing resources are in AR 11–1 and staff personnel. Whichever activity thecommander designates to assist with implementing the CSDP, the designated activity will then incorporate the CSDPpolicy in their evaluation plans and procedures. All existing supply evaluation programs will absorb the CSDP.Additionally, local inspector general’s can be used at the commander’s discretion to conduct special inspections usingthe systemic methodology for determining root causes for problems identified through the CSDP. Therefore, command-ers will not establish new evaluation teams because of the CSDP.
c. The CNGB will enforce each state ARNG CSDP. Using the ARNG Command Logistics Review Team to ensure
federal property is accounted and protected under the provisions of 32 USC 710.
