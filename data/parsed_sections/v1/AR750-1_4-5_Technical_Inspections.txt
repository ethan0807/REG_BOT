made by technically qualified individuals assigned to a field -level or sustainment -level maintenance activ-
ity. Inspections will be performed accordi ng to equipment maintenance and serviceability standards appli-
cable to the maintenance level performing the repair. The results of TIs will be used to determine and/or 
verify the following:

(2)  Economic reparability of the item.  
(3)  Extent of maintenance effort and repair parts required to restore the item to the prescribed service-
able condition.
