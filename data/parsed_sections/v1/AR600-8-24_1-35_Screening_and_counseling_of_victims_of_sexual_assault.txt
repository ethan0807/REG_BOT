1  –  35.  Screening and counseling of victims of sexual assault  
a.  When recommending an administrative separation for any officer for any reason, including retirement, covered 
by this regulation, commanders must ensure the separation packet contains a statement signed by the officer, with the 
officer’s answers to the following questions (see AR 600  –  20): 
(1)  Did you file an unrestricted report of a sexual assault in which you were a victim within the past 24 months?  
(2)  If the answer to paragraph  1–35a(1) is YES, do you believe that this separation action is a direct or indirect 
result of your sexual assault, or your reporting of the sexual assault?  
b.  The officer’s General Court -Martial Convening Authority (GCMCA) or higher authority will review all admin-
istrative separations involving known victims of sexual assault and officers who answered YES to any of the questions 
cited on their signed statement as stated in parag raph 1–35a. The reviewing authority will determine — 
(1)  Does the separation appear to be in retaliation resulting from the officer filing an unrestricted sexual assault 
report? If so, consult with your local staff judge advocate.  
(2)  Does separation i nvolve a medical condition that is related to the sexual assault? If so, consult with the appro-
priate medical command personnel.  
(3)  Is the separation in the best interest of the Army, the Servicemember, or both? If not, consult with your local 
staff judg e advocate.  
(4)  Commanders will include a statement that the separation was reviewed in accordance with paragraphs 1 –35a 
and 1–35b.
