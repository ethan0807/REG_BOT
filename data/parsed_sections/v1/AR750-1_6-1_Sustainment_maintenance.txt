6–1.  Sustainment maintenance  
Combat vehicles will be selected as candidates for recapitalization and overhaul during peacetime under 
the CVE Program. ACOMs, ASCCs, and DRUs will report combat vehicles requiring sustainment mainte-
nance support to, and receive disposition instructions from, the appropriate  commodity command. Selec-
tion criteria for equipment:  
a.  Combat vehicles reaching a mileage or hour interval prescribed by AMC will be inspected by sus-
tainment -level teams to identify vehicles requiring overhaul. Only the vehicles meeting the scoring cri teria 
will be directed for return to AMC depot. A copy of the evaluation will accompany the vehicle when it is 
sent to an overhaul facility. Approved repair candidates will be scheduled and turned in to depot mainte-
nance shops in accordance with the CVE Program. (See para 4  –  9 for transfer/turn -in standards.)  
b.  Combat vehicles that do not yet reach the prescribed mileage or hour threshold but are considered 
to be overhaul candidates by the user ACOM, ASCC, and DRU may be nominated by the ACOM, ASCC, 
and DRU for evaluation by the teams.  
c.  Combat vehicles requiring extensive modernization or recapitalization in a depot facility may be in-
ducted without benefit of the CVE. These vehicles will be overhauled and /or rebuilt to a like -new condition 
in conjunction with the modernization or recapitalization DMWR, national maintenance work requirement 
(NMWR), or statement of work.  
d.  When a replacement item is not available and the depot cannot overhaul and return it to user, the 
ACOM, ASCC, and DRU commander can authorize units to continue using the item.
