4  –  10.  Discipline  
a.  CDS personnel will discipline in a consistent way, based on an understanding of individual needs and behaviors of 
children at varying developmental levels. Simple, understandable rules will be esta blished so that expectations and limita-
tions are clearly defined.  
b.  Discipline will be constructive in nature, including such methods as diversion, separation of child from situations, 
praise of appropriate behavior; or gentle physical restraint such as holding.  
c.  A child may not be punished by — 
(1)  Spanking, pinching, shaking, or other corporal punishment. (See para 2  –  28 for touch policy.)  
(2)  Isolation away from adult sight/contact.  
(3)  Confinement in closets, boxes, or similar places.  
(4)  Binding to restrain movement of mouth or limb.  
(5)  Humiliation or verbal abuse.   

 (6)  Deprivation of meals, snacks, outdoor play opportunities, or other program components. Short term restrictions on 
the use of specific play materials and equipment or participation in a specific activity are permissible.  
(7)  Extended periods of “time out” (e.g., in excess of one minute per year of age).  
d.  A child may not be punished for lapses in toilet training or refusing food.  
e.  Highchairs and cribs will not be used for discipline purposes.  
f.  Biting policies will focus on modifying child behavior within the existing environment rather than “suspending” the 
child. When this is not possible, the SPS director will assist parents in obtaining care in another CDS setting if available.
