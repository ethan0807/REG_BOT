3–2.  Sustainable Readiness Model  
Maintenance is to be an enabling process for meeting Sustainable Readiness Model ( SRM) requirements 
as outlined i n AR 525  –  29. The SRM is the framework used by the Army to forecast readiness objectives 
and mission risk for units and Army capabilities over time. The SRM produces a representation of current 
and planned force unit readiness objectives; it enables re source synchronization (to include the balancing 
of readiness investments across the total force) while assisting senior leader visualization of risks to mis-
sion resulting from projected unmet operational demand requirements. The sustainable readiness pro-
cess replaces the Army’s progressive readiness process known as Army Force Generation.
