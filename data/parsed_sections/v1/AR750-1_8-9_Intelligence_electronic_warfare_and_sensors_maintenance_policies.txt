a.  CECOM ILSC has sole responsibility within  the Army for IEW logistics sustainment. As part of this 
responsibility, all sustainment contracts will be consolidated under the control of CECOM LCMC. Central-
ized support for IEW materiel will be extended to all fielded systems, including systems fie lded for proto-
typing analysis, independent of current level of acquisition management.  
b.  The emerging generation of IEW systems requires a sustainment concept that provides for repair as 
far forward on the battlefield as possible. The RSC provides this  support to the field as well as system 
and maintenance troubleshooting and PPSS repair, along with a reconfiguration capability. All these ca-
pabilities are integrated under the ESSC when possible.
