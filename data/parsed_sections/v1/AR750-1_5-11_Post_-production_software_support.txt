5–11.  Post -production software support  
a.  Life cycle software support embraces all software -related activities for a weapon system embedded 
operational softwa re. Post -production software support ( PPSS) is a subset of life cycle software support 
that begins with completion of the weapon system software increment production in accordance with 
DoDI 5000.02.  
b.  Planning and programming for PPSS begins prior to Milestone A of the weapon system. PPSS sus-
tainment programing and execution begins during the first FY after the software increment production of 
the weapon system is completed.  
c.  The MATDEV is responsible for all software support and PPBE activities  until the weapon system 
software increment production is complete. The transition to sustainment begins at the full rate production 
decision and is complete no later than IOC plus 3 years in accordance with DoDD 5000.01.  
d.  When it is appropriate to tr ansition software support PPBE system responsibility from the MATDEV 
to the Life Cycle Software Engineering Center ( LCSEC ) prior to the end of the weapon system software 
increment production (to include block upgrades), the MATDEV, in coordination with the LCSEC, will ob-
tain DCS, G  –  4 and ASA (ALT) approval and document the approved transition date.
