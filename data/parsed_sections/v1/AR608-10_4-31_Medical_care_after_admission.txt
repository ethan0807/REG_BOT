a.  Sponsor consent.  
(1)  Parents will give consent on DA Form 4719  –  R for CDS personnel to take child for care, medical or dental, in an 
emergency situation where the child’s condition represents a serious or imminent threat to life, health, or well– being. 
Conscious efforts will be made to notify a parent prior to such action. However, emergency treatment at an Army medical 
facility may be provided without additional consent under the provision of AR 40  –  3, paragraph  2  –  19. 
(2)  Parents of children using services in extended hours and long term FCC homes where length of care exceeds 24 
hours must provide a special power of attorney. (See AR 40  –  3, para 2  –  19 and DA Pam 27  –  12 for format for special power 
of attorney.)  
b.  Medical emergencies.   Children who develop conditions after admission that require immediate medical attention 
will be brought to a medical facility for evaluation. Conditions  that require immediate medical care include convulsions; 
marked difficulty in breathing; unconsciousness; laceration (either significant in size or amount of bleeding); injury to an extremity with obvious deformity; head trauma associated with vomiting or  altered consciousness.  
c.  Minor health problems.   Children who develop minor health problems after admission will be handled in the follow-
ing manner:  
(1)  CDS personnel will notify the parent or parent –designee should the child become ill or injured during the time in 
care.  
(2)  Ill children will generally remain in an isolated area away from other children until such time as reasonable arrange-
ments can be made for the child’s release to the parent or parent –designee. See paragr aph 6
 –  9 for children in FCC homes.  
(3)  If there is a question about the course of action to be taken, CDS personnel should refer the matter to the health 
consultant.
