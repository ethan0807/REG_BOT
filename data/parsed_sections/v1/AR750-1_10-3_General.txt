Heavy canvas classification and repair was previously performed by MOS 43M (Fabric Repair Specialist) 
Soldiers within maintenance units. With the consolidation of MOS 43M and MOS 57E (Laundry and 
Shower Specialist) into MOS 92S (Shower/Laundry and Clot hing Repair Specialist), the capability to re-
pair heavy canvas was eliminated. The rationale for eliminating the capability is that heavy canvas items 
are no longer being procured. The replacement items are made from a vinyl material that can be repaired 
by the owning organization using a repair kit.
