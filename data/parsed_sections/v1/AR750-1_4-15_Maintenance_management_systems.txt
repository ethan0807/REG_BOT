4–15.  Maintenance management systems  
a.  The DCS, G  –  4 mand ates the use of approved standard Army LIS, which takes precedence over the 
manual system when operational.  
b.  The primary functions of maintenance management include forecasting, distribution, scheduling, 
and production control of maintenance workloads,  including inspections, services, repairs, and warranty 
claim actions for Army equipment.  
c.  Approved TELS ( GCSS –Army, LMP, ACN, etc.) will be the DA standard for The Army Maintenance 
Management System ( TAMMS) and TAMMS –Aviation automation and will  take precedence over all man-
ual systems, ACOM, ASCC, and DRU, installation -unique and CLS automation for Army materiel mainte-
nance management. Materiel management procedures for each authorized TELS can be found in each 
system applicable end -users -manual. Combat and MATDEVs, as well as contract requirement packages 
will require contractors to use approved LIS or approved and/or negotiated automated logistical system. 
Where circumstances do not allow this, data interfaces between CLS-unique systems and authorized lo-
gistics systems are required.  
d.  The DoD Medical Logistics Standard Support is the automated maintenance management system 
for the TDA medical maintenance activities. MTOE medical maintenance units use GCSS –Army for medi-
cal equipment reporting. GCSS –Army, Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support and Theater Army 
Medical Materiel Information System are the systems used for maintenance management and ordering of 
class VIII repair parts.
