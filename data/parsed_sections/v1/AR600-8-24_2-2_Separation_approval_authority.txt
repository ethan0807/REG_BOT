Commanders listed in paragraphs 2 –2a through 2–2c are known as separation approval authorities (SAAs). The SAA 
cannot disapprove a request (with the exception of HRC for USAR AGR officers) but will make a recommendation 
and forward to Commander, Human Resources Comma nd (AHRC  –  OPD  –  A), 1600 Spearhead Division Avenue, Fort 
Knox, KY 40122  –  5400; The Judge Advocate General (DAJA  –  PT), 2200 Army Pentagon, Washington, DC

as applicable; or for USAR AGR officers, to Commander, Human Resources Command (AHRC  –  AR), 1600 Spear-
head Division Avenue, Fort Knox, KY 40122  –  5400. The CG, HRC or equivalent authority is the SAA for all fully 
qualified requests outside the  provisions of Stop Loss; however, cases involving ADSO waivers may either be ap-
proved/disapproved by the appropriate waiver level or the requested separation date may be deferred to the end of the 
respective ADSO to prevent the officer from reapplying for  REFRAD. This authority will not be further delegated 
without prior approval of SECARMY.
