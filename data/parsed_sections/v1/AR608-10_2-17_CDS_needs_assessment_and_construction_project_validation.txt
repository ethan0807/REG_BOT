2  –  17.  CDS  needs assessment and construction project validation  
a.  Data required to determine child development construction requirements will be collected by the installation to justify 
and validate project scope as determined according to architectural and engineering instructions (AEI). Space requirements 
will be based on waiting list data, needs assessment information, and demographic data collected using the following 
forms.  
(1)  DA Form 5561  –  R Waiting List (Child Development Services).   The installation CDS coordinator will provide a 
summary of the actual day –to–day need for child care as documented by this form.  
(2)  DA Form 5562  –  R Needs Assessment (Child Development Services).   The installation CDS coordinator will survey 
current patrons and eligible military and DOD civilian sponsors assigned or attached to the installation to determine the nature and extent of child care needs using DA Form 5562
 –  R. 
(a)  Distribution methods will ensure inclusion of on and off –post personnel assigned to the installation  including those 
not enrolled in CDS programs as well as current patrons.  
(b)  The form may be modified to reflect additional specific installation characteristics, but must include items shown 
on the original form.  
(c)  DA Forms 5561  –  R, DA Form 5562  –  R, DA Form 5562  –  1  –  R, and DA Form 5563  –  R will be completed and for-
warded with a copy of the corresponding DD Form 1391 through the MACOM to Commander, USACFSC, ATTN: CFSC
 –  SF  –  CY, 2461 Eisenhower Ave., Alexandria, VA 22331  –  0521, when a new facility  is programmed. (See AR 
415  –  15 for milestones concerning submission of MCA funded projects and see AR 415  –  19 for NAF information.)  
(3)  DA Form 5562  –  1  –  R Needs Assessment Methodology (Child Development Services).   The installation CDS coordi-
nator wi ll use DA Form 5562  –  1  –  R to document the method of distribution, return rate, and population surveyed. DA Form 
5562  –  1  –  R will be reproduced locally on 81⁄2 by 11– inch paper. A copy of the form for reproduction is located at the back 
of this regulatio n. 
(4)  DA Form 5563  –  R Demographic Profile (Installation Child Development Services).   The installation CDS coordi-
nator will obtain demographic profile data from the installation information, on current and projected military and civilian  

 personnel assig ned to the installation. The CDS coordinator will collect data reflecting actual and potential sources of child 
care on the installation and in the surrounding civilian community. DA Form 5563  –  R will be reproduced locally on 81⁄2 
by 11– inch paper. A copy  of the form for reproduction is located at the back of this regulation.  
b.  The CDS coordinator will ensure the sample completed DD Form 1391 is provided to the installation facilities engi-
neer for use in preparation of the form for any CDC project submission.  
c.  DA Forms 5561  –  R, 5562  –  R, 5562  –  1  –  R, and 5563  –  R will be completed and forwarded with a copy of the corre-
sponding DD Form 1391 through the MACOM to Commander, USACFSC, ATTN: CFSC  –  SF  –  CY, 2461 Eisenhower 
Avenue, Alexandria, VA 2233 1  –  0521, when a new facility is programmed. (See AR 415  –  15 for milestones concerning 
submission of MCA funded projects and see AR 415  –  19 for NAF information.)  
d.  These same procedures will be followed periodically, but at a minimum every two years to  assess and validate the 
installation demand for services even if construction is not anticipated. data will be used as input to the installation five –
year plan.  
e.  The FCC and SPS systems will be developed to the fullest extent possible prior to submission of the DD Form 1391 
request for construction of child care facilities for expansion purposes. Expansion facilities may not be programmed — 
(1)  In lieu of offering diversified and low cost alternative child care services through the FCC and SPS system.  
(2)  With the intention of eliminating these care options pending construction of a CDC.
