General (under honorable conditions) characterization of service.   An officer will normally receive an under \n honorable conditions characterization of service when the officer\u2019s military record is satisfactory but not sufficiently \n meritorious to warrant an honorable discharge. A separation under honorable conditions will normally be appropriate \n when an officer \u2014 \n (1)  Submits an unqualified resignation or a requ est for REFRAD under circumstances involving misconduct.  \n (2)  Is separated based on misconduct, including misconduct for which punishment was imposed, which renders \n the officer unsuitable for further service, unless an under other than honorable conditions  separation is appropriate.  \n (3)  Is discharged for physical disability resulting from intentional misconduct or willful neglect, or which was \n incurred during a period of unauthorized absence.  \n (4)  Is discharged for the final revocation of a security clearance under DODI 5200.02 and AR 380  \u2013  67 as a result \n of an act or acts of misconduct, including misconduct for which punishment was imposed, unless a discharge under \n other than honorable conditions i s appropriate.  \n c.

To be eligible for REFRAD under this paragraph, an officer must have\u2014  \n (1)  Completed the current period of service required by law or the minimum period required by the program that \n placed  the officer on AD as a commissioned or warrant officer.  \n (2)  Fulfilled the following additional service requirements, as applicable: \n (a)  Officers who have departed the CONUS normally will be required to complete the current prescribed tour for \n the areas of assignment as specified in AR 614  \u2013  30, unless returned earlier under existing policies.  \n (b)  Officers who have attended service schools or civilian educational institutions or participated in special training \n for which a utilization tour is required, o r who have received continuation or accession pay, normally will complete \n the period of service specified. The period of service will be as specified by AR 350  \u2013  100 and other appropriate regu-\n lations under which officers applied for or received such school ing or benefits.  \n (c)  Officers on orders for assignment to a military mission, a Military Assistance Advisory Group, or attach\u00e9 office \n must complete their training and the OCONUS tour of duty prescribed by AR 614  \u2013  30. \n (d)  All other officers who receive a PCS will be required to serve 1 year at their new duty station.   \n \n  (e)  Service academy graduates and ROTC DMG who are released/separated from AD before completing their \n ADSO will complete the remainder of their ADSO in the selected Reserve.

However, exception requests will be considered on an individual \n basis provided the application for REFRAD is received by commanders exercising GCMCA jurisdiction or command-\n ers at a compar able level of command. The exception request must be forwarded within 30 calendar days of receipt \n of the alert or reassignment order, whichever is earlier, and the requested effective date cannot be more than 6 months \n subsequent to date of application.

However, new allegations must support a reason \n for elimination that was included in the find ings of the selection board or in the officer\u2019s notification memorandum. \n The board may recommend retention (with or without reassignment) or involuntary separation. The board will include \n the type of discharge certificate and characterization to issue, when elimination is recommended (and the officer is \n not retirement eligible (see 10 USC 1186, 10 USC 7311, 10 USC 12731, or 10 USC 14905)) for misconduct, moral \n or professional dereliction, or in the interest of national security.  \n (3)  The board may not recom mend removal of documents such as OERs; UCMJ, Art. 15; and Memoranda of \n Reprimand from an officer\u2019s AMHRR.

Actions concerning Board of Inquiry defects  \n At any time after receipt and review of a case by  the GOSCA or CG, HRC, the following actions may be taken with \n respect to substantial defects that may be noted:  \n a.  The retention of the officer may be directed.  \n b.  If the Board of Inquiry has failed to make findings or recommendations required by the applicable regulations, \n the case may be returned to the same board for compliance with the regulations concerned. Section IV of the DA Form \n 1574  \u2013  2 (and the verbatim record, if required) must clearly state the member\u2019s findings, to include a factual basis f or \n each finding. If the board members find that the officer did or did not engage in the conduct or acts as alleged on the \n notification letter, the findings should normally mirror the language in the notification letter and include the factual \n basis for th e finding. If the board\u2019s findings differ slightly from the allegations on the notification letter, the finding \n must include the additional facts or deletions supporting the amended findings.  \n c.  If there is an apparent procedural error or omission in the record of proceedings that may be corrected without \n reconsideration of the findings and recommendations of the board, the case may be returned to the same board for \n corrective action. Where the findings are deficient because they don\u2019t state in detail the factual basis for the board \n members findings, the board may be reconvened to conduct deliberations in any manner sufficient for the members to \n discuss and memorialize their findings (see para 4\u201316b and para 4\u201315b(2)). Once the amended findings are reached, \n they must be provided to the respondent and counsel for comment and approved by the GOSCA prior to forwarding \n the package for further processing.  \n d.  If the Board of Inquiry committed an e rror, other than as is dictated in paragraphs 4 \u201316b and 4\u201316c, that sub-\n stantially prejudiced a substantial right of the officer, the case may be returned for a rehearing by a new board. The \n new board may be furnished the evidence properly considered by the previous board, including extracts from the \n record of testimony of those witnesses not deemed reasonably available to testify at the rehearing. The new board may \n call additional witnesses. Ne w allegations that could form the basis for an elimination under paragraph  4  \u2013  2 may be \n presented to the new Board of Inquiry. First, however, the officer will be given notice of the new allegations and \n provided an opportunity to respond. The case will then be processed as stated in paragraph  4  \u2013  18. The  new board will  \n \n  not be advised of the findings and recommendations of the previous board. The new board\u2019s findings and recommen-\n dations may not be less favorable than that of the previous board unless additional allegations are considered. Like-\n wise, the recommendation of the appointing authority may not be less favorable than initial recommendation, unless \n additional allegations are considered by the subsequent board.  \n e.  When a case is returned to the board pursuant to paragraph 4 \u201316b or 4\u201316c, and one or more members of that \n board are unavailable because of factors such as death, hospitalization, or PCS, new members may be appointed. The \n case may proceed with an opportunity to challenge the mem bers and after the substance of all proceedings is made \n known to the new member or members and the recorded testimony of each witness previously examined is made \n known to the new member.

Overview  \n a.  This chapter prescribes the rules and steps for eliminating officers for substandard performance of duty, mis-\n conduct, moral or professional dereliction, and in the interests of national security.  \n b.  An officer is permitted to serve in the Army because of the special trust and confidence the President and the \n nation have placed in the officer\u2019s patriotism, valor, fidelity, and competence. An officer is expected to display re-\n sponsibility commensurate to this special trust and confidence and to act with the highest integrity at all times. How-\n ever, an officer who will not or cannot maintain those standards will be separated.  \n c.  Every officer deserves a fair chance to demonstrate their capabilities. When an officer shows ineffective tenden-\n cies (especially if the officer is inexperienced), when practicable, he or she will be given another chance under another \n commander. The officer \u2019s ineffectiveness will be systematically recorded in documents that specify each period cov-\n ered, duties observed, and defects noted. Recommendations for elimination action will not be based on generalities \n and vague impressions. It is necessary to documen t, in writing, the precise reasons an officer is considered ineffective.  \n d.  A USAR or ARNG officer must hold, or be capable of holding, a security clearance of at least secret. An RA \n officer must hold a security clearance of at least secret. This requirem ent may not be waived. The final denial or \n revocation of an officer\u2019s Secret security clearance by appropriate authorities acting pursuant to DODI 5200.02 and \n AR 380  \u2013  67 requires the discharge of that officer from the service. An officer whose security cl earance has been \n withdrawn or withheld due to unfavorable information regarding loyalty, subversion, or security violations may be \n processed for involuntary separation under AR 380  \u2013  67; however, the officer should first be considered for discharge \n under t his regulation. The administrative procedures prescribed in AR 380  \u2013  67, will be followed until the case is re-\n ferred to HRC (AHRC  \u2013  OPD  \u2013  A). \n e.  Commanders, and/or initiating officials designated in paragraph  4\u201318a of this regulation, will initiate elimination \n action of any officer convicted of a sex offense, as defined in 34 USC 20911or AR 27  \u2013  10, whose conviction did not \n result in a dismissal. This applies to all officers regardless of when the conviction for a s ex offense occurred, except \n when the officer has already been subject to an elimination action and has been retained.  \n Note.  Officers who are deployed to a nonpermitted location OCONUS in any status (temporary duty (TDY)/temporary \n change of station (TCS)) w ill immediately be returned to their parent organization. The only permitted OCONUS \n locations are Hawaii, Alaska, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the territories or possessions of the United States. \n Command responsibility to reassign or redeploy an off icer takes precedence over immediate initiation of elimination \n action. Officers convicted of a sex offense, as defined in 34 USC 20911 or AR 27  \u2013  10 will first be reassigned or \n redeployed to a CONUS or permitted OCONUS location. The receiving commander wil l subsequently ensure the \n initiation of elimination action.  \n f.  Officers with a subsequent alcohol or drug- related incident of misconduct at any time during the 12 -month period \n following successful completion of the Army Substance Abuse Program or during t he 12 -month period following \n removal from the program, for any reason, will be recommended for elimination as an alcohol or drug abuse rehabil-\n itation failure.

Based upon the findings of fact established by its in-\n vestigation and recorded in its report, the board t hen makes a recommendation for the officer\u2019s disposition, consistent \n with this regulation. The Government is responsible to establish, by preponderance of the evidence, that the officer \n has failed to maintain the standards desired for their grade and branch or that the officer\u2019s Secret -level security clear-\n ance has been permanently denied or revoked by appropriate authorities acting pursuant to DODI 5200.02 and AR \n 380  \u2013  67. In the absence of s uch a showing by the Government, the board will retain the officer. The respondent is \n entitled to produce evidence to show cause for retention and to refute the allegations. The respondent\u2019s complete \n AMHRR will be entered in evidence by the Government and considered by the Board of Inquiry.  \n b.  Boards of Inquiry are appointed by the appropriate GOSCA. Concurrence must be obtained from the appropriate \n commander when an officer assigned to a different command is used on a Board of Inquiry. The local installat ion \n convening the Board of Inquiry will fund the travel of board members from other installations.  \n c.  The GOSCA will advise members of a Board of Inquiry that duty on the board takes priority over all other duties \n unless properly excused by the appointing  authority.  \n d.  The Board of Inquiry will be completed no later than 120 calendar days from the date the GOSCA is notified by \n HRC to conduct the Board of Inquiry or, on a GOSCA initiated elimination, 90 days from the date the GOSCA directs \n that a Board of Inquiry be conducted.

If an officer is in more than one category and requests officers from all or two \n categories, the board membership may be met by one or more officers (if reasonably available, as this provision is not  \n an entitlement).

Retirement in lieu of permanent change of station  \n a.  Officers may request retirement in lieu of PCS when they have at least 19 years and 6 months AFS and a firm \n PCS alert is received. The retirement request must be submitted within 30 calendar days of the alert. When an alerted \n officer indicates  that he or she might exercise the option to retire in lieu of PCS, Career Division may initiate a request, \n with recommendation to approval authority CG, HRC, to disapprove or delay the retirement based on the needs of the \n Army.  \n b.  Assignment alert is the  official notification of an impending assignment sent by writing, voice, email, or other \n medium from DA or HRC assignments officials to an officer. An assignment is considered \u201cfirm\u201d when an officer has \n been selected to fill a valid requisition (that is, when and where the officer will be assigned).  \n c.  All service obligations must be met (or waived) before retirement. The MPD will verify service obligations by \n contacting the officer\u2019s career management division before forwarding the retirement request. Th e waiver request \n must be documented with detailed justification. Requests that are not forwarded through channels will be returned.  \n d.  An officer retiring in lieu of PCS will normally remain at the same duty station until retirement unless the needs \n of th e service or local circumstances clearly require reassignment (for example, due to deletion of the position, reor-\n ganization, or disciplinary problems). If possible, the officer will be reassigned within the same installation if there is \n a valid need. When this is not possible, the officer may be reassigned to the closest military installation where there is \n a valid need. An officer will not be reassigned exclusively for the purpose of being closer to the requested location of \n retirement.  \n e.  The officer may  request the retirement to be effective any date not later than 6 months from the date of the PCS \n alert or the first day of the month after the officer attains 20 years AFS, whichever is later.  \n f.  Once a retirement is approved, the appropriate career management division will revoke the PCS orders and notify \n the officer.

Officer retirement program  \n a.  This chapter applies to nondisability retirement of ADL commissioned and warrant officers on AD to include \n AGR commissioned and warrant officers who have 20 years or more of AFS. To retire in a commissioned officer \n grade above the warrant officer grades, an officer must generally have at least 10 years of active service as a commis-\n sioned officer (see 10 USC 7311).  \n b.  A commissioned officer in the rank of major and below may voluntarily retire in the highest rank served satis-\n factorily on AD for 6 or more months unless entitled by law to a higher grade (see 10 USC 1370).  \n c.  A commissio ned officer must serve on AD 3 years in grade to voluntarily retire in rank above major. However, \n the Secretary of Defense has authorized SECARMY to waive this requirement to not less than 2 years in individual \n cases involving extreme hardship or exception al or unusual circumstances (see 10 USC 1370).  \n d.  Under 10 USC 1370, an officer who is serving in or who has served in the grade of general (O  \u2013  10) or lieutenant \n general (O  \u2013  9) may be retired in that grade only after the Secretary of Defense certifies i n writing to the President and \n Congress that the officer served on AD satisfactorily in that grade. A reduction to not less than 2 years\u2019 time in grade \n for a general officer grade to retire in grade may only be exercised if the Secretary of Defense or anot her civilian \n official in the Office of the Secretary of Defense appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of \n the Senate, first approves the reduction and provides advance notice to the Committees on Armed Services of the \n House and Sena te (see 10 USC 1370). In the case of an officer who is serving in or who has served in the grade of \n general (O  \u2013  10) or lieutenant general (O  \u2013  9), the 3 -year service in grade requirement may not be reduced or waived \n while the officer is under investigatio n for alleged misconduct, or while there is pending the disposition of an adverse \n personnel action against the officer for alleged misconduct (see 10 USC 1370).  \n e.  Generally, unless entitled to a higher retired grade under some other provision of law, or reduced in accordance \n with a grade determination review conducted under the provisions of AR 15  \u2013  80, a warrant officer retires as determined \n by SECARMY in the permanent Regular or Reserve warrant officer grade, if any, that he or she held on the day before \n retirement or in the higher warrant officer grade, if any, in which he or she served on AD satisfactorily, as determined \n by SECARMY, for a period of more than 30 days (see 10 USC 1371). Retirement in the grades of CW3 through chief \n warrant officer f ive (CW5) for warrant officers serving on the ADL require a minimum of 2 years of AD in the current \n grade, unless entitled by law to a higher grade upon retirement. The CG, HRC may approve exceptions to 2 -year \n service requirement in individual cases when a pproval is in the best interest of the Army, or when substantial hardship \n of the warrant officer would result (see DODI 1332.20).  \n f.

Computati on of service  \n a.  There are different types of creditable military service. Each type is computed according to the applicable pro-\n visions of federal law for the various types of retirement. AFS is applicable for retirement under this chapter. For \n mandatory retirement of an RA commissioned officer, AFS may include constructive service (for a commissioned \n officer on AD on ) and is computed to determine whether \u2014 \n (1)  An RA or RC officer may retire voluntarily.  \n (2)  An RA commissioned or warrant  officer must be retired mandatorily.  \n (3)  A warrant officer may be advanced to a higher commissioned grade.   \n \n  b.  Retired pay is computed according to pay formulas in 10 USC Chapter 71 and 10 USC Chapter 371 provisions \n contained in the retirement law, and a ccording to 37 USC.  \n c.  Upon appointment in the RA, certain commissioned officers are credited with constructive service. This amount \n of service is used to determine the RA grade and placement on the ADL and counts as mandatory retirement service \n for commi ssioned officers on AD before . When the mandatory retirement service is greater than \n the total service for basic pay, it is used as the multiplier in determining the percentage in computing retired pay. No \n period of service subsequent to the date the officer meets the service requirements for mandatory retirement is cred-\n itable in the computation of retired pay unless specified by law.  \n d.  For voluntary retirements that do not require a waiver and do not appear to involve retirement of a Regular \n commissioned officer with at least 30 but less than 40 years of active service for retirement purposes, service compu-\n tations will be performed at the installation maintaining the local personnel file or MPF, as appropriate of the retiree. \n For general  officers, JAGC officers, chaplains, officers managed by the Special Management Branch, Regular com-\n missioned officers with at least 30 but less than 40 years of active service for retirement purposes, and those that \n require waiver, service computations wil l be performed by the supporting service center and forwarded with the re-\n spective retirement request for validation to HRC (AHRC  \u2013  OPD  \u2013  A). Service computations for USAR officers not on \n the ADL will be performed by HRC (AHRC  \u2013  AR). For those retirements w here the GCMCA or designee is the ap-\n proval authority, HRC (AHRC  \u2013  MSR) will provide the AMHRR of the retiree to the installation upon request. When \n service has been computed for retirement or retired pay and an officer claims additional service that is not  stated in \n the current official U.S. Army Register or the officer\u2019s AMHRR, the officer will contact the installation for recompu-\n tation of service. The officer will provide justifying documents. The documents must be certified statements of service, \n dischar ge certificates, or other official evidence. These documents will be submitted at least 6 months prior to the \n retirement date, to allow time for verification and updating of the records. Officers of the USAR who are not on the \n ADL will contact HRC (AHRC  \u2013  AR) for recomputation of service.  \n e.

CDS concept  \n a.  CDS is a network of child care delivery systems through which the Army provides quality child development options \n that reduce the conflict between parental responsibilities and unit mission requirements. Increasing numbers of sole and \n dual military parents, co upled with an increase in working spouses and the frequent relocation of Service families, have \n combined to increase demand for child care.  \n b.  Soldiers look to the military establishment to provide services that assist parents in their child \u2013rearing respo nsibili-\n ties. The military family does not have the stability of an established neighborhood or the proximity of relatives to allow \n for a constant and reliable child care plan. Off \u2013post civilian programs are often inaccessible, unaffordable, and have limite d \n operating hours. Most private child care operations do not provide care for infants or toddlers, have no hourly services, \n and have waiting lists for vacancies. Off \u2013post family day care homes are often not licensed or certified and may be un-\n monitored for health, safety, and quality of service factors.  \n c.  CDS is designed to assist commanders in fulfilling their morale and welfare responsibilities to soldiers and their \n families. CDS should identify child care needs and coordinate installation resources to m eet service demand. To effectively \n accomplish this task, command commitment to and involvement in CDS operations is essential.  \n d.  Child care is not considered an entitlement, CDS is offered as a supplement to, not a substitute for the family as the \n primar y agent for the care and development of the child. Quality CDS options can strengthen and sustain child and parent \n relationships. However, the Army and parents should work together to ensure that these options for care will exist.  \n e.  CDS offers care optio ns with various types of service, locations, hours of operation, and fee schedules that are re-\n sponsive to the needs of military families living both on and off \u2013post.  \n (1)  CDC services within centralized installation facilities offer closely monitored, structured group experiences relevant \n to the age and development of the child.  \n (2)  FCC homes within government owned or leased quarters, or privately owned housing on an installation offer a \n family atmosphere with a limited number of children, flexible ho urs, and the capability of addressing special requirements.  \n (3)  SPS increase child care capabilities by providing on and off \u2013post alternative child care programs and support ser-\n vices.

CDC Patron fees.  \n (1)  Facility based programs shall be operated, maintained and funded with direct APF at least equal to the amount of \n user fees collected.  \n (2)  Parent fees collected for center child care services can be used only to compensate employees directly involved in \n providing child care (e.g., caregiving staff including teachers) and for child development center food service and sanitation  \n expen ses (e.g., cook salary, cleaning supplies, food, etc.), consumable supplies, and some non \u2013capital equipment.  \n (3)  Parent fees may not be used to compensate management and clerical staff. These positions must be paid with APF \n or NAF other than those from pa rent fees.  \n e.  FCC Providers.   \n \n  (1)  Direct and or indirect APF support are authorized for FCC providers who provide care for the children of members \n of the Armed Forces and DOD civilian employees. APF subsidies can help reduce the turnover and indirect cost s of pro-\n vider training, screening, and home inspections as well as maintain user fees at an affordable level. The FCC APF subsidy \n is the differential between the true cost of child care and that portion of the costs passed on to the patron as a fee.  \n (2)  Provision of the FCC subsidy assistance program will be at the discretion of the installation commander and should \n be implemented when necessary to ensure eligible patrons receive FCC child care services comparable to the quality and \n cost of similar services in military CDCs and or to increase the availability of care for a specific age group (e.g., infants) or type (e.g. hourly) of care. Prior to offering the subsidy assistance program an update ICCAP will be completed to verify \n true need (e.g., competition  with other delivery systems will be avoided; current and projected installation demographics \n will be considered).  \n (a)  Provisions for direct APF subsidies may include, but are not limited to food subsidies for OCONUS providers and \n subsidies to encourage p roviders to offer child care services which would be significantly more costly to provide in a \n center \u2013based setting, e.g., sick child care, special needs care, care of HIV infected children, and extended hours care.", "doc_id": "755e0da9-d196-4913-b9f8-e8630b4d589f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a7c6b585af37b6a0cc36aa1d53df94025d3a578c821cda5489ee1eaf0aa24659", "extra_info": {"regulation": "AR608-10", "section_number": "3-2", "section_name": "APF support"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3696, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": 186, "3": "8a4d9752-46f2-4ac7-88e5-ae248d9c5e0e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a4d9752-46f2-4ac7-88e5-ae248d9c5e0e": {"__data__": {"text": "care, special needs care, care of HIV infected children, and extended hours care.  \n (b)  Provisions for indirect APF subsidi es which may include, but are not limited to access to toy and equipment lending \n libraries including provisions for long \u2013term consignments; provision of expendable curriculum/program supplies; full or \n partial payment of RIMP annual provider assessment cost ; or a substitute provider pool for selective/ emergency purposes \n (e.g. medical appointments, special off \u2013site training, provider \u201cvacation\u201d day and or respite care).  \n (3)  Potential for increasing the availability of care, providing affordable care, improv ing the quality of care, and high \n turnover of FCC providers should be considered by the installation before establishing an FCC subsidy assistance program. \n Installations will also determine unique conditions which make subsidizing appropriate, (e.g., finan cial capability of eligi-\n ble personnel; unusual service requirements and unique mission related provider responsibilities; fee structures of other \n available military child care operations and adjacent civilian programs in comparison to FCC fee ranges; number of chil-\n dren being served; and the installation child care waiting list).  \n (4)  The FCC director will be responsible for administrative functions according to HQDA procedural guidance to in-\n clude:  \n (a)  Developing a Standing Operating Procedure (SOP) for the  FCC subsidy assistance program.  \n (b)  Coordinating with office responsible for resource management.  \n (c)  Provisions for publicizing the FCC subsidy assistance with FCC providers and parent users.  \n (d)  Monitoring the operation of the FCC subsidy assistance program according to the established SOP.  \n f.

General.   CDS user fees, registration fees, and miscellaneous charges for optional services (e.g., music lessons and \n sports for school \u2013age children) are authorized.  \n (1)  Annual registration and miscellaneous fees are authorized per child or  per family.

Mission support requirements after duty hours and during mobilization, deployments and contingencies.  \n (1)  Patrons who have mission requirements, mobilization, deployment, contingency or TDY responsibilities after nor-\n mal duty must make their own arrangements for child care.  \n (2)  CDS will support unit requirements for child care during training exercises, and alerts to the extent possible. The \n SPS director or CDS coordinator will assess installation and priv ate sector resources and advise unit commanders of child \n care options appropriate to specific requirements. Such recommendations will consider center \u2013based extended care, FCC \n Extended Hours and Long Term Care homes, trained CDS baby \u2013sitters, and Army Commu nity Services foster homes, as \n well as available off \u2013post options.  \n (3)  In accordance with installation requirements, a designated number of FCC providers should be recruited to provide \n child care services which support mission requirements after normal du ty hours. When the FCC system has limited open-\n ings, new provider applicants should be restricted to those who agree to provide extended hours and long term care services \n if there is an unmet demand for these services.  \n (4)  Center operating hours for full \u2013day programs will reflect installation variable duty hours including accommodations \n for alerts and physical training schedules for active duty military, when the demand for extended hours care is for 10 or more children (or fewer children if determined appr opriate by the installation commander).  \n (5)  The installation commander will consider needs of sole/dual military parents and emergency essential civilians \n when determining the operational hours for programs within CDS system.  \n (6)  Sole/dual military parents and emergency essential DOD civilians will be given priority for services when care is \n needed to meet mission requirements.  \n (7)  Service members required by AR 600\n  \u2013  20 to have a family care plan (FCP) and all single parents emergency essen-\n tial sin gle parents, where both parents are emergency essential and dual military couples who use CDS for regularly sched-\n uled care options (full, part\u2013 day care, part \u2013day school \u2013age care and part \u2013day preschool programs) must provide accurate \n FCP information which w ill remain in the CDS Central Enrollment Registry. A duplicate copy of this information will be \n retained in the child\u2019s file in the primary child care setting. Parents will provide update information to the SPS director \n annually or more frequently if neces sary to update information. The SPS director will forward new information to the \n primary child care setting.  \n (8)  As an addendum to the ICCAP ( Chap  2, Sec VIII), CDS staff and installation functional proponents will develop a \n Mobilization and Contingency (MAC) plan.

Structure and policy  \n The CDC system will  reflect installation needs for program services according to the analysis process described for con-\n struction justification in paragraph 2  \u2013  17. Comprehensive services will include a full range of full \u2013day, part \u2013day and hourl y \n care programs, and child \u2013age group categories as determined through installation needs assessments and demographics in \n paragraph 2 \u201317d. \n a.  Full\u2013 day program.   The full \u2013day program includes CDC developmental services that m eet the needs of working \n parents requiring child care 5 to 12 hours per day on a regularly scheduled basis. It will include program provisions for \n infants, toddlers, and preschool \u2013age children where demand exists. School \u2013age children may attend on a full \u2013day basis at \n times of public school recess.  \n (1)  Total enrollment of full\u2013 day children, including infants, may exceed up to 10 percent of child activity room/ module \n capacity or age group assignment to compensate for a reduced average daily attendance due t o absenteeism.  \n (2)  Programs designed for full \u2013day care will provide a stable environment that is responsive to the child\u2019s developmen-\n tal needs for consistency. The program will be staffed with a majority of regularly scheduled caregiving employees who will be assigned to specific groups of children as specified at paragraphs  5\n  \u2013  13 and 5  \u2013  14. \n (3)  Full\u2013day slots of absent, regularly enrolled children may not be filled by other children attending on an intermittent \n basis except in small centers according to paragraph  5\u20132b(4). \n (4)  Newborn infants, up to six weeks, of  single or dual military sponsors, may be served in CDC settings when the \n following conditions are met:  \n (a)  Placement in FCC newborn home is not possible.  \n (b)  Maximum group size within child activity room or module home base is limited to seven children under one year \n of age ( table  5  \u2013  1). \n (c)  A 1:2 adult/child ratio is maintained with these infants with no more than two newborn children included in the \n group of seven infants.  \n (d)  Exposure to multiple caregivers will b e limited.  \n (e)  Newborn infants will not be combined with other groups during early morning arrival and end of day departure \n periods or in a multi \u2013age setting.  \n (5)  Children enrolled in full\u2013 day preschool \u2013age programs will not leave their activity room/mod ule to attend a separate \n part\u2013day preschool \u2013age program. The quality of full \u2013day and part \u2013day preschool \u2013age programs will be equivalent so as  \n \n  to eliminate the need for parents to enroll children in more than one program. Program reorganization to include r edistri-\n bution of personnel, space allocation, and program resources may be necessary to achieve this comparability.  \n b.  Hourly care program.   The hourly care program includes developmental services for children that meet the needs of \n parents requiring short term child care on an intermittent basis. Hourly care services will include program provisions for \n infant, toddler, preschool \u2013age, and school \u2013age children where demand exists.  \n (1)  Hourly care services will be provided by reservation to ensure cost e ffective scheduling of personnel. A well \u2013\n publicized system for reserving and canceling care arrangements will be established to enable use of last minute canceled space by patrons waiting for hourly care on a space available basis. Walk \u2013in care may be prov ided as space is available.  \n (2)  Hourly care services are not intended to replace requirements for full or part \u2013day care. When demands for care do \n not conform to full or part \u2013day program schedules, an adjustment in operating hours of these programs may be appropriate \n to meet patron needs and preclude allocation of hourly care spaces to meet this requirement. The CDC director will ensure \n that hourly care spaces are retained for short term intermittent services.

(See para 4\u20136c for admission requirements.) This number \n will be recommended by the CDC director and CDS coordinator and approved by the installation commander. Command-\n ers may dedicate these spaces; however any loss of income incurred s hould be made up from the installation MWR fund \n rather than increased fees for other CDC patrons.  \n (4)  Hourly care services will be physically separated from full \u2013day and part \u2013day services either by designating specific \n areas within the same facility or by  separate facilities. This requirement may be waived in centers with less than a 60 \u2013\n child \u2013space capacity, in which case provisions will be made to stabilize the environment to the greatest extent possible for \n children enrolled on a regular basis. Children enrolled in hourly care and full \u2013day care programs which occupy a single \n facility may be combined up to 11\u20442 hours during early morning arrival and end of the day departure time periods.  \n (5)  Programs for hourly care will be developmentally appropriate and  will maintain a flexible environment that will \n reduce separation anxiety and facilitate program adjustment to an ever \u2013changing clientele of children and parents.  \n c.  Part\u2013day program.   All part\u2013 day programs include developmental services up to five hours a day that meet the needs \n of parents requiring child care on a regularly scheduled part \u2013day or seasonal basis. Part \u2013day programs include part \u2013day \n self contained programs for preschool children ages 3 through 5, school \u2013age care programs (that is, before and  or after \n school, summer programs) for children 5 through 12, and part \u2013day child care to meet the needs of parents working outside \n the home (for example, parents employed part time, enrolled in an educational program part time, or employed as shift workers ) with children (6 weeks \u201312 years old).  \n (1)  Part\u2013day sessions for children up to 5 years of age should be a minimum of three hours in duration and should not \n exceed 5 hours. When waiting lists for full \u2013day care exist, expansion of part \u2013day program hours or reduction of space \n allocated to part \u2013day sessions should be considered as a means of addressing the full \u2013day unmet demand.  \n (2)  Demands for part \u2013day preschool \u2013age care should not be satisfied without ensuring large scale unmet demands for \n full\u2013day care are similarly addressed. Space allocations for center programs will be analyzed to ensure preschool programs \n are not utilizing an amount of activity space inconsistent with program mission and installation priorities for service.  \n (3)  Part\u2013day preschool programs will support, as necessary, the requirements of working parents who do not require \n full\u2013day care, parents who augment FCC services with center \u2013based part \u2013time programs, and regular short \u2013term care \n requirements for installation volunteers. The directo r of the part \u2013day program will keep data which reflects such use of \n this program.  \n (4)  Part\u2013day school \u2013age (PDSA) programs offered by the CDC will be limited to care for children 5 through 12 years \n of age. Children may attend before and after school and at tend on a full \u2013day basis at times of public school closure.

A copy of \n the signed Statement of Understanding will be retained on file within the FCC syst em. \n c.  A Parental Statement of Understanding Regarding Family Child Care ( fig 6  \u2013  4), with optional permission/waiver \n regarding transportation of children in private vehicles, must be signed by the parent/guardian of the child for whom care is provided.  \n d.  Authorized NAF claims costs associated with the FCC program will be determined by the Commander, USACFSC \n or his designee. Once so determined, the local morale, welfare, and recreation fund will be assessed its share o f these costs \n by USACFSC. The local fund should recover these costs from the individual FCC providers prior to provisional certifica-tion and annually thereafter. The Installation Financial Management Division will issue duplicate prenumbered receipts. \n A co py of this receipt will be kept in the FCC provider\u2019s file and the provider will keep the other copy.

Care for children with unique requirements (e.g., handicapping conditions when a home is \n determined to be the least restrictive environment  by the Special Needs Resource Team).  \n (b)  Newborn/infant homes.   Care for newborn and young infants birth \u201312 months. Care for infants birth through 4 \n weeks is restricted to children of sole/dual military parent(s) when the soldier is required to return to  duty before the child \n is old enough to be eligible for other child care options. Homes will be monitored at least bi\u2013 monthly by FCC personnel \n and as requested by preventive medicine staff. Approval of homes must be coordinated locally on a case by case basis.  \n (c)  HIV homes.   Care for children ages 4 weeks \u20136 years and children ages 6  \u2013  12 years who lack control of their body \n secretions (whether because of age or physical/mental handicap) regardless of their stage of infection with the HIV.  \n (d)  Bilingual/b icultural homes.   Care for children where parents have a preference for a particular language or cultural \n focus. Providers will meet the requirements in paragraph  6  \u2013  14. \n (e)  Sick child homes.   Care for children who are too ill to remain in their usual center \u2013based or FCC setting or who are \n recuperating from hospitalization, but are not seriously ill or require professional nursing care. Care may also be provided \n to chronically ill children who do not require hospitalization,  but can not, (for their safety or the safety of others) be enrolled \n in other CDS settings.

In center \u2013based settings, CDC facility standards are waived when parents are on \u2013site or immediately accessible \n for the duration of the child care session. However, installation fire, safety, health, and SPS proponents must certify that \n the site meets basic safety and health needs according to local SOPs.  \n c.  The SPS delivery system will provide common support services for existing CDC and FCC systems, offer optional \n programs and services to supplement the CDC and FCC services when there is an unmet demand for child care, and serve \n as an alternative delivery system at remote sites or small installations where  establishment of a CDC or FCC homes is not \n feasible.  \n d.

It is\n directed at standardizing supply discipline throughout the Army. Also, the CSDP is meant to simplify command,supervisory, and managerial responsibilities. Simplification is accomplished by outlining the various requirements forresponsible personnel, by standardizing requirements, and by formalizing follow-up procedures.\n b. The CSDP is a commander\u2019s program. Brigade and battalion commanders will implement the CSDP using\n existing resources. Examples of existing resources are in AR 11\u20131 and staff personnel. Whichever activity thecommander designates to assist with implementing the CSDP, the designated activity will then incorporate the CSDPpolicy in their evaluation plans and procedures. All existing supply evaluation programs will absorb the CSDP.Additionally, local inspector general\u2019s can be used at the commander\u2019s discretion to conduct special inspections usingthe systemic methodology for determining root causes for problems identified through the CSDP.

Actions to take when individuals admit negligence\n a. Voluntary payment limitations. The following persons may pay the actual loss to the Government in cash, check,\n or payroll deduction, except when a DD Form 200 or an AR 15\u20136 investigation is mandatory:\n (1) All Service members and civilian employees of the Active Army or USAR, or members and employees of the\n ARNG may admit financial liability and offer cash, check, or payroll deduction payment in an amount not to exceedthe person\u2019s monthly basic pay. This also applies to the payment of an individual\u2019s share of collective liability whenmore than one person has been assessed with financial liability. Table 12\u20133 shows how to compute financial liabilityagainst one person. Figure 12\u20134 illustrates how to compute collective and individual liability against two or morepersons. DOD civilian will see their human resource service representative for DD Form 2481 (Request for Recoveryof Debt Due the United States by Salary Offset) for payroll deduction submission.\n (2) A contractor admitting financial liability, for any amount, may pay by cash, or check. The use of a DD Form\n 362 for a payroll deduction is not an option for a contractor admitting liability.\n b. Replacement by cash purchase. A person who admits liability may voluntarily purchase replacements for lost or\n damaged hand tools or OCIE from the SSSC or CIF.\n (1) Allow depreciation per appendix B.(2) Accept payment made by cash or check.(3) When lack of item availability prevents immediate purchase, account for the lost or damaged hand tools or OCIE\n items by using the DD Form 362. The procedures for initiation and processing a DD Form 362 are contained inparagraph 12\u20133.\n (4) For ARNG, the USPFO may authorize replacement in kind when lack of item availability prevents cash sale of\n hand tools at the SSSC. This rule does not apply to Active Army and USAR members. USPFO sale of hand tools toARNG members and to ARNG technicians is optional.\n (5) No cash sales will be made without a DD Form 362 or a written authorization signed by the person\u2019s\n commander or designated representative. The authorization statement follows: \u201cI authorize (name and grade) topurchase the following hand tools (or OCIE). Purchased items will remain the property of the Government.\u201d Allowabledepreciation is chargeable to the accounting classification for the mission and/or base operation element funding theoperations in which the tools or OCIE were used.\n (6) Prepare the statement in original and make two copies. The unit retains copy two of DD Form 362 until copy\n one is returned to the unit by the individual making the purchase. After verification that the purchase was actuallymade from the authorized source, and accountability has been restored, copy two may be destroyed. The individualmaking the purchase retains copy one.

When the loss of Government\n property is discovered during the conduct of an AR 15\u20136 investigation, a DD Form 200 must be initiated to adjust theproperty records and to assess financial liability, when appropriate. The initiator will do the following:\n 1. Blocks 1 through 8. Prepare the DD Form 200 in accordance with figure 13\u20134 and instructions in paragraph\n 13\u201310 d. If the investigation involves more than one item, prepare blocks 1\u20138 in accordance with paragraph 13\u201310 b(1).\n 2. Block 9. Insert the words, \u201csee AR 15\u20136 investigation.\u201d Identify the location of the AR 15\u20136 investigation if not\n attached as an exhibit due to security classification.\n 3. Block 13b. Sample is as follows: Recommend financial liability against Captain (CPT) Doe for failure to properly\n provide records in which to ensure proper custody was maintained. The circumstances in block 9 shows that CPT Doefailed to keep any records of equipment as it was issued or hand receipted to the users or supervisors. In fact, there isnot a single valid sub hand receipt for any property. He failed to ensure that these records were maintained by anyone.Although CPT Doe had a great amount of supply personnel turbulence during his command, the onerous of the failureto keep any hand receipts lies with him along. He never asked nor did he seek to see the company\u2019s or supervisor\u2019shand receipts. If he knew the fact that no hand receipts were kept, he did nothing to rectify the issue. He had manychances to fix his problem during cyclic inventories and command inspections. The loss of this equipment was caused\n by this lack of records. Recommend that CPT Doe be held liable for the loss of the equipment which totaled $ 34,834.\n 23 after depreciation. CPT Doe\u2019s monthly base pay is $4,149.30 (see WAH8AA\u201314\u2013FA\u2013055).\n 4. Block 14b. Sample is as follows: Financial liability is assessed against CPT Doe for failure to properly provide\n equipment records. This one act ultimately ended in the loss of equipment because the equipment was issued andforgotten. CPT Doe\u2019s rebuttal gave no further evidence to show who the equipment was issued or hand receipted to.Approved to hold CPT Doe, SSN, financially liable for the amount of $ 4,149.30. CPT Doe\u2019s monthly base pay is$ 4,149.30. (See WAH8AA\u201314\u2013FA\u2013055.)\n 5. Block 16.a.

Refer to table 13\u20131 to determine the propergrade of a financial liability officer. If the financial liability officer discovers during the investigation that completionof the investigation will require them to examine the conduct or performance of duty of someone senior, or may resultin a finding and recommendation adverse to a person senior to them, the financial liability officer will report that factto the approving authority. The approving authority will review the findings, and either excuse the financial liabilityofficer and designate another person senior to the individual concerned, or direct the investigation to continue ifmilitary exigencies make the change impractical. When employing the military exigency option, the approvingauthority will document the military exigency as an exhibit to the DD Form 200.\n c. No person may act as the financial liability officer who is personally responsible for, or is in any way directly\n interested in the property listed on the DD Form 200.\n d. An accountable officer will not act as the financial liability officer for losses or destruction of equipment on their\n accountable records.

Financial liability officer\u2019s responsibilities\n A financial liability officer\u2019s responsibility is to determine the cause and value of the loss or damage of Government\n property listed on the DD Form 200, and to determine if assessment of financial liability is warranted. Thatdetermination must be determined from the facts developed during a thorough and impartial investigation. However,before beginning the investigation the financial liability officer must have an understanding of the terms \u201crespon-sibility, culpability, proximate cause, and loss;\u201d each term impacts upon a determination of financial liability. Individu-als may be held financially liable for the loss or damage of Government property if they were negligent or havecommitted willful misconduct, and their negligence or willful misconduct is the proximate cause of that loss ordamage. The following terms are addressed in order to assist the financial liability officer in evaluating financialliability:\n a. Responsibility.(1) General. The type of responsibility a person has for property determines the obligations incurred by that\n individual for the property. DA Pam 735\u20135 presents specific issues the financial liability officer must consider beforerecommending financial liability.\n (2) Command responsibility. The obligation of a commander to ensure all Government property within their\n command is properly used and cared for, and that proper custody, accountability, safekeeping, and disposition ofGovernment property are provided. Command responsibility is inherent in command and cannot be delegated. It isevidenced by assignment to command at any level and includes the following:\n (a) Ensuring the security of all property within the command, whether in use or in storage.\n (b) Observing subordinates to ensure their activities contribute to the proper custody, care, use, accountability,\n safekeeping, and disposition of all property within the command.\n (c) Enforcing all security, safety, and accounting requirements.\n (d) Taking administrative or disciplinary action when necessary.\n (3) Supervisory responsibility. The obligation of a supervisor to ensure all Government property issued to, or used\n by its subordinates, is properly used and cared for, and that proper custody, safekeeping and disposition of the propertyare provided. It is inherent in all supervisory positions and is not contingent upon signed receipts or responsibilitystatements. It arises because of assignment to a specific position and includes the following:\n (a) Providing proper guidance and direction.\n (b) Enforcing all security, safety, and accounting requirements.\n (c) Maintaining a supervisory climate that will facilitate and ensure the proper care and use of Government property.\n (4) Direct responsibility. The obligation of a person to ensure all Government property for which they have\n receipted is properly used and cared for, and that proper custody, accountability, safekeeping, and disposition areprovided. Direct responsibility results from assignment as an accountable officer, receipt of formal written delegation,or acceptance of the property on-hand receipt from an accountable officer.\n (5) Custodial responsibility. The obligation of an individual for property in storage awaiting issue or turn-in to\n exercise reasonable and prudent actions to properly care for, and ensure proper custody, safekeeping and disposition ofthe property are provided. Custodial responsibility results from assignment as a supply sergeant, supply custodian,supply clerk, or warehouse person. Personnel with custodial responsibility are rated by and answerable directly to theaccountable officer or the individual having direct responsibility for the property. Responsibilities includes thefollowing:\n (a) Ensuring the security of all property stored within the supply room and storage annexes belonging to the supply\n room or SSA is adequate.\n (b) Observing subordinates to ensure their activities contribute to the proper custody, care, safekeeping and disposi-\n tion of all property within the supply room and storage annexes belonging to the supply room", "doc_id": "b377eeab-a4b7-4cbd-ab90-0cef41eb5255", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4ff31f65b3f68baaec3a5496c0247c33ef152d6c4c86fcaa3d1bafa7c3de9009", "extra_info": {"regulation": "AR735-5", "section_number": "13-29", "section_name": "Financial liability officers responsibilities"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4133, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": 431, "3": "5ee27c33-ef7f-48f3-8e4d-be3acc493e29"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ee27c33-ef7f-48f3-8e4d-be3acc493e29": {"__data__": {"text": "all property within the supply room and storage annexes belonging to the supply room or SSA.\n (c) Enforcing all security, safety, and accounting requirements.\n (d) When unable to enforce any of these, reporting the problem(s) to their immediate supervisor.\n (6) Personal responsibility. The obligation of a person to exercise reasonable and prudent actions to properly use,\n care for, safeguard and dispose of all Government property in their physical possession. It applies to all Governmentproperty issued for, acquired for, or converted to a person\u2019s exclusive use, with or without receipt.\n b. Culpability.(1) Before a person can be held financially liable, the facts must show that they, through negligence or willful\n misconduct, violated a particular responsibility or duty involving the property.\n (2) Simple negligence is the absence of due care, by an act or omission of a person which lacks that degree of care\n for the property that a reasonably prudent person would have taken under similar circumstances, to avoid the loss or\n damage of Government property.\n (3) Gross negligence is an extreme departure from due care resulting from an act or omission of a person\n accountable or responsible for Government property which falls far short of that degree of care for the property that areasonably prudent person would have taken under similar circumstances. It is accompanied by a reckless, deliberate,or wanton disregard for the foreseeable loss or damage to the property.\n (4) Whether a person\u2019s acts or omissions constitute negligence depends on the circumstances of each case. Negli-\n gence under some circumstances may not reflect negligence under other circumstances. Therefore, fully consider thefollowing factors, as a minimum, when determining the reasonableness of a person\u2019s conduct:\n (a) The person\u2019s age, experience, physical condition, and special qualifications.\n (b) The type of responsibility the person had toward the property.\n (c) The type and nature of the property.\n (d) The nature, complexity, level of danger, or urgency of the activity ongoing at the time of the LDDT of the\n property.\n (e) The adequacy of supervisory measures or guidance for property control.\n (f) The feasibility of maintaining close supervision over the property, given the nature and complexity of the\n organization or activity supervised.\n (g) The extent supervision could influence the situation considering pressing duties or lack of qualified assistants.\n (5) Willful misconduct is any intentional wrongful or unlawful act or omission relating to Government property.(6) A retired military member or civilian employee can be held financially liable for the loss or damage of\n Government property that can be attributed to their negligence while on active duty or employed by DA.\n c. Proximate cause. Before holding a person financially liable for a loss to the Government, the facts must clearly\n show that the person\u2019s conduct was the \u201cproximate\u201d cause of the LDDT. That is, the person\u2019s acts or omissions werethe cause that, in a natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by a new cause, produced the LDDT, and withoutwhich the LDDT would not have occurred.\n d. Loss. Before holding a person financially liable for a loss to the Government, the facts must clearly show that the\n person\u2019s conduct was the \u201cproximate\u201d cause of the loss or damage. That is, the person\u2019s acts or omissions were thecause that, in a natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by a new cause, produced the loss or damage, and withoutwhich the loss or damage would not have occurred.", "doc_id": "5ee27c33-ef7f-48f3-8e4d-be3acc493e29", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "095aae91a47657da5ce2be94263e529029c2ffb0ee71eed074b1d4a9292a4987", "extra_info": {"regulation": "AR735-5", "section_number": "13-29", "section_name": "Financial liability officers responsibilities"}, "node_info": {"start": 4049, "end": 7621, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": 431, "2": "b377eeab-a4b7-4cbd-ab90-0cef41eb5255"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c5b84ad-0e08-4edb-b2ee-4e40fec95c88": {"__data__": {"text": "\n 13\u20132.

A financial liability\n officer\u2019s task is to seek out all the facts that surround the loss or damage of Government property. The followingparagraphs will assist the financial liability officer in collecting data needed to develop the findings:\n a. A financial liability officer must stay free from bias or prejudice. An investigation should not be started with\n predetermined ideas as to what caused, or who is to blame for the LDDT. A thorough investigation may establish nofault, or it may establish that financial liability should be recommended.\n b. The financial liability officer must begin the investigation immediately upon notification of being appointed\n financial liability officer.\n c. As first priority, physically examine any damaged property, and release it for repair or turn-in. If expert opinion\n will be of value in determining the cause of damage, or the cost of repair, ensure that technical inspectors examine theproperty and give statements regarding any damaged property. If the damaged property is the result of a vehicularaccident involving a GSA vehicle or a rental vehicle rented from a commercial activity, and the proof of damages(such as, photographs) and estimated cost of damages were documented according to paragraph 13\u201312 e, it is not\n necessary for the financial liability officer to release the vehicle for repair or turn-in. However, the financial liabilityofficer must rely on this documentation in lieu of physically examining the damaged vehicle.\n d. Interview and obtain statements from all individuals whose useful testimony may assist in deciding the cause of,\n or responsibility for, the LDDT of the property listed on the DD Form 200. For losses or damages previouslyinvestigated by a board of officers, military police, or other authorized official, obtain a copy of the report, or extractedinformation and attach it to the DD Form 200 as an exhibit. When using classified or otherwise sensitive references,make a statement to that effect in block 15a along with the location and identification of the investigation report.Obtain other available exhibits such as hand receipts or ECODs.\n e. Statements and other evidence provided by persons who were responsible for the property listed on a DD Form\n 200 may be self-serving. The financial liability officer must confirm, through the use of other independent statementsand evidence gathered in the financial liability investigation, if available, as well as any other evidence of reliabilitythat the financial liability officer considers relevant to indicate that such statements and evidence are factual.\n f. The evidence provided by different persons may conflict. The financial liability officer must resolve conflicts and\n determine the true facts, as far as possible, by comparing the conflicting versions with other known facts, surroundingcircumstances, and common sense.\n g. The evidence provided by different persons may conflict. The financial liability officer must resolve conflicts and\n determine the true facts, as far as possible, by comparing the conflicting versions with other known facts, surroundingcircumstances, and common sense.\n h. Obtain and mark evidence as follows and attach to each copy of the DD Form 200:\n (1) Prepare witness statements on DA Form 2823. When DA Form 2823 is not available, use plain bond or ruled\n paper, 8\n 1\u20442 by 11 inches, with the word \u201cCertificate\u201d typed or legibly printed across the top. Statements and/or\n certificates will be dated and signed by the individual giving the statement and/or certificate.\n (2) Mark the bottom of each exhibit alphabetically, followed with the date, amount, and organization or account\n shown on the face of the DD Form 200 (for example, \u201cExhibit A, DD Form 200, , $375.00, Co Z, 906thSignal Battalion.\u201d)", "doc_id": "10db0720-5e55-4212-80da-31d7cce37b71", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f149058fbbaec47afb896dd78cc6e0624b37413dc8e9d595aef000e8931117a6", "extra_info": {"regulation": "AR735-5", "section_number": "13-31", "section_name": "Conducting the investigation"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3930, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": 434}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9a8af3a-b2eb-4042-bb64-6617c703b729": {"__data__": {"text": "\n 13\u201332.

When the approval authority is the garrison commander, the\n IMCOM region director will be the appeal authority.

Individuals designated must be in the grade ofCOL or above, or be an SES employee, and be senior in time-in-grade to the approving authority. This provision doesnot apply to the ARNG. In the ARNG, the AG is the appeal authority for financial liability investigations of propertyloss. This authority may be delegated to the Deputy AG only.

Policy\n Except as indicated below, the following policy applies to ASDAs and to U.S. Joint Munition Command site, arsenals,\n supply depots, maintenance depots, and other storage activities (such as, prepositioned afloat ships). The depot willprepare an DA Form 444 for all losses not resolved by causative research at the ASDA. Table 15\u20131 gives the criteriafor causative research.\n a. Exceptions to this criteria are as follows:\n (1) Losses of controlled items that require an AR 15\u20136 investigation.(2) Losses for which negligence or willful misconduct is known or suspected. A DD Form 200 is required in these\n cases.\n (a) For weapons and ammunition (see AR 190\u201311).\n (b) For COMSEC material (see AR 380\u201340).\n (3) Losses for which the accountable property officer (ACTPO) believes the DA Form 444 prepared by the depot\n does not adequately explain the loss. In these cases the ACTPO may require a DD Form 200 instead of an DA Form444.\n (a) DA Forms 444 must be prepared by depots for all losses identified by error cause codes 8Y and 8Z, when\n causative research at the ASDAs result in no conclusive findings.\n (b) When losses are equal to, or less than the dollar values specified in table 15\u20131, the ACTPO may request an DA\n Form 444 from the depot as an exception, if enough justification exists. The ACTPO always has the option ofrequesting a financial liability investigation of property loss if the DA Form 444 does not explain the loss adequately.\n b. The ASDA will prepare an DA Form 444 for all other adjustments that\u2014\n (1) Do not require causative research.\n (2) Result in a conclusive finding from causative research.(3) Result in no conclusive finding from causative research, but are below the dollar value thresholds in table 15\u20131.c. The approving authority will appoint financial liability officers for financial liability investigations of property\n loss. Within the AMC national supply system the approving authority may require the respective depot commander toappoint a financial liability officer from depot personnel resources. The depot commander may delegate administrativerequirements; however, the depot commander must sign the proper blocks reserved for the appointing authority. Theappointing authority actions on DD Form 200, blocks 13a through 13h, will be taken at the depot.\n d. The commander of the ASDA may designate the Director of Materiel Management, or equivalent as the financial\n liability investigation of property loss approving authority, provided the individual filling the position is an Armyofficer in the grade of colonel or above, or a DA civilian employee in a supervisory position, in the grade of GS\u201315 orabove. If the Director of Materiel Management does not meet the criteria discussed above, the first individual in thechain of command who qualifies will be the approving authority.\n e. A military officer in the grade of brigadier general or above at the ASDA will act as the appeal authority for\n financial liability investigations of property loss.\n f. To ensure the proper working of the financial liability investigation of property loss system, the depot commander\n will take action including, but not limited to the following:\n (1) Appoint one of the persons cited in paragraph 13\u201327 as the financial liability officer.(2) The ASDA and depot commanders will ensure complete and accurate entries in the following blocks of DD\n Form 200:\n (a) Block 9. (Circumstances under which property was (X one)).\n (b) Block 15a. (Findings and Recommendation).\n g. Depot commanders will assign a reviewing authority for national assets stored at their depot.\n h. The Director or Deputy Director of Materiel Management at ASDAs will be designated as the DA Form 444\n approving authority.\n i.

Such incident or insecurity reporting will be accomplishedimmediately upon discovery of the loss.\n j. Accountability and the ACTPO for assets held at national storage activities will reside at the storage activity; the\n former custodial record at the storage activity will be the accountable record. This accountable record will bemaintained solely by the storage activity. Within AMC, the term \u201cstorage activity\u201d refers to Operations SupportCommand storage activities, both CONUS and outside continental United States, to include both Government-ownedand/or Government-operated and Government-owned contractor-operated site and arsenals. It also refers to preposi-tioned afloat ships, each of which is a separate storage activity; to the U.S. Army Communications-ElectronicsCommand Communications Security Logistics Activity storage activity at Tobyhanna Army Depot; and to nationalmaintenance activities, which are performing maintenance functions on ASDA-owned or customer-owned assets.\n k. DLA, other Service, and Army storage activities will conduct causative research based on the criteria in table\n 15\u20131 and investigate all adjustments for which causative research results in no conclusive findings. DLA, other Servicestorage activities, and Army activities storing DLA stocks will use DD Form 200 to document the results of thecausative research and the DD Form 200. The DLA and other Service storage activities will provide copies of eachcompleted DD Form 200 to each of the ASDAs affected by the loss or gain. Preparation of DD Form 200 is explainedin DOD 7000.14\u2013R.\n l. Accountability and the ACTPO for national assets not held at a national storage activity will reside with the\n ASDA. Assets at a contractor for repair, assets on loan, and assets in transit between storage activities (other than onpost) are examples of this category of assets. The asset record maintain by the ASDA will remain the accountablerecord for these assets. This accountable record will be maintained solely by the ASDA. For these assets, the ASDAwill conduct causative research as outlined above using DA Form 444 and DD Form 200.\n Table 15\u20131\n Criteria for causative research\n Adjustment Causative research required\n Of $5,000, or less.

Send a\n copy to Operations Support Command within 5 days after the suspense date.\n (5) If the depot does not reply to the first follow-up, the ASDA will send a second follow-up 20 days after the first\n to Operations Support Command. Send copies to the depot commander and to AMC (AMSDS\u2013SM\u2013SA) for ammo, andDefense Logistics Agency (DLA\u2013OW) for general supplies.\n (6) A depot submits an DA Form 444 or DD Form 200 to an ASDA. The original 90-day suspense period for that\n action ends on its submission of the DA Form 444 or DD Form 200 to the ASDA. In all cases when other actions arerequested by ASDAs, a new suspense period of 60 days for financial liability investigations of property loss and 30days for DA Form 444 will apply, for example, when returning an DA Form 444 or DD Form 200 to the submitter formore action.\n (7) ASDAs will receive DA Form 444 in original and 2 copies from depots and review them for completeness and\n accuracy (see fig 15\u20131). An ASDA has 30 days to approve an DA Form 444 or return it to the depot for more action.\n If the DA Form 444 is satisfactorily completed, the ACTPO will forward it through the Chief of Distribution and\n Transportation to the Director of Materiel Management for approval.

Step 4\u2013Initiating an SF 364\n a. General. As stated in paragraph 16\u20132 d, this section addresses property accountability aspects. It gives procedures\n for use by Army receiving installations and activities to report and adjust item (supply) discrepancies as defined inparagraph 16\u20137 c. This section also outlines the relationship between SF 364 and DD Form 200 actions.\n (1) When submitted, a SF 364 serves to suspense received overages, shortages and damaged Government property\n until disposed of or taking authorized adjustment action. The SF 364s clearly identify discrepancies and deficienciesinvolving the shipper of materiel (depot or contractor) or initiator of the shipments. Even though SF 364s do notalways result in financial liability investigations of property loss, SF 364 investigations can lead to that requirement asshown below and at table 16\u20131.\n (2) Discovery of a discrepancy involving the shipper usually occurs when matching the supply documents or making\n an item count after opening shipping cartons in the activity\u2019s receiving area.\n (a) Situation. Shipment received.\n (b) Type of shipment. Parcel post, commercial carrier and military transportation.\n (c) Discrepancy. Comparison of document and tally shows not all items received from shipping activity (that is,\n depot, contractors, manufacturers and vendors). Nonreceipt of parcel post shipments, shipments from vendors, packag-ing and item discrepancies.\n (d) Action by receiving personnel. The receiving personnel will\u2014\n 1. Check criteria for preparation of SF 364.\n 2. Prepare SF 364 and forward to proper officer (that is, inventory control point (ICP) or inventory manager).\n (3) AMC has delegated responsibility to AMC Packaging, Storage and Containerization Center as the final arbitrator\n for unresolved and contested SF 364s appealed by the requestor.\n (a) Lateral redistributions of major items for intra-ACOM, ASCC, and/or DRU lateral redistributions of major items,\n policies on discrepancy reporting and issue of credit will be established by the applicable ACOM, ASCC, and/or DRU.\n (b) For inter- ACOM, ASCC, and/or DRU lateral redistributions of major items, the losing activity has the\n responsibility for ensuring the items meet TM 10 series and/or TM 20 series standards prior to shipment, per AR750\u20131. Gaining activities will report discrepancies to the losing activity citing estimated or actual repair costs andrequest reimbursement.\n (4) SF 364 policy for lateral transfers of equipment and/or major items between ACOMs. The losing activities must\n meet TM 10 series and/or TM 20 series standards on all equipment transfers between ACOMs, ASCCs, and/or DRUs,as stated in AR 750\u20131. Discrepancies are to be reported by the gaining activity directly to the losing activity forresolution SF 364 procedures. An information copy of the SF 364 will be provided to the national level ICP.\n (a) Charges and reimbursement. AR 750\u20131 lists parts, labor (which includes both civilian and military), material,\n and direct and indirect costs (to include temporary duty costs for technical inspections). These charges are alsoappropriate for reimbursement on SF 364s against equipment transfers between ACOMs, ASCCs, and/or DRUs whenthe equipment does not meet maintenance and equipment standards found in TM 10 series and/or TM 20 series whichis available at the Logistics Information Warehouse (https://www.logsa.army.mil/etms). Reimbursements on such SF364s, as with packaging SF 364s, will be made for actual costs incurred.

If the reporting criteria shown below apply, report a shipping-type item discrepancy by\n submitting a SF 364 (see fig 16\u20132 for preparation instructions).\n (1) Shipping-type (item) discrepancies. This involves supply discrepancies in shipments from DOD activities (in-\n cluding materiel returns from DOD and FMS customers), GSA supply distribution facilities, and from contractors,manufacturers, or vendors. Reporting criteria applies to the types of discrepancies and dollar values to report.

Questionable situations may require simultaneous submission of both a DD Form 361 and a packaging SF364. Check top block on SF 364 to identify packaging discrepancies.\n (4) Time standards for submitting SF 364. Submit SF 364s within the timeframes stated in your SOP.\n (a) Nonreceipt of parcel post shipment. As added clarification, report non-receipt of parcel post shipments from\n contractors, manufacturers or vendors on a shipping type (item) SF 364 within time frames specified in your SOP.

The obligation of a person to ensure all Government property for which they have\n receipted, is properly used and cared for, and that proper custody, safekeeping, and disposition are provided. Directresponsibility results from assignment as an accountable officer, receipt of formal written delegation, or acceptance ofthe property on hand receipt from an accountable officer. Commanders or directors of separate TDA activities willdetermine and assign in writing those individuals who will have direct responsibility for property.\n (4) Custodial responsibility. The obligation of an individual for property in storage, awaiting issue, or turn-in to\n exercise reasonable and prudent actions to properly care for, and ensure proper custody, safekeeping, and disposition ofthe property are provided.

The specific type of responsibility depends on therelationship of the person to the property. Accountability and the five types of responsibility are separate obligations.They are incurred for separate reasons.\n a. Accountability and each type of responsibility carry specific duties. Financial liability can be assessed against any\n person who fails, through negligence or misconduct, to perform those duties and where such failure is the proximatecause of a loss to the Government (see para 13\u201329 c).\n b.

This direct responsibility may be further delegated to thestorage supervisor.\n (2) At the property book level, the appointment as a PBO carries with it direct responsibility for all the property\n carried on the property book records that has not been issued on hand receipt. Property issued by a PBO on handreceipt (called the primary hand receipt) carries with it the delegation of direct responsibility for the property listed.Further hand receipting (sub-hand receipting) does not transfer direct responsibility nor relieve the primary hand receiptholder of their duties.\n c.

General policy\n a. Interim requirement. A short-term, urgent requirement due to transitory peak military missions, deployments,\n military contingency operations, disaster relief requirements, or pending approval and construction of real propertyfacilities via normal military construction programs. The short term requirement must have an approved exit plan todispose of the facility or facilities.\n b. Relocatable building and/or facility. Personal property used as a structure, that would have a building category\n code if it were real property, designed to be readily moved, erected, disassembled, stored, reused, and meets the 20percent rule. Personal property is managed as equipment.\n (1) The sum of building disassembly, repackaging, and nonrecoverable building components, including typical\n foundation costs must not exceed 20 percent of the purchase cost of the relocatable building and/or facility. If thepercentage is greater than 20 percent, then the facility must be acquired as real property and follows real propertyproject approval authorities. Typical foundations include blocking, footings, bearing plates, ring walls, and slabs thatare an integral part of the relocatable building facility. Foundations do not include construction cost of real propertyutilities, roads, sidewalks, parking, force protection, fencing, signage, lighting, and other site preparation (clearing,grubbing, ditching, drainage, filling, compacting, grading, and landscaping). Slabs that are real property and not part ofthe actual building are not counted in the 20 percent.\n (2) Tents that use real property utilities will be considered relocatable buildings and/or facility.c. Site preparation project approval.(1) Site preparation costs are classified as construction because the items installed are permanent in nature and\n become real property-foundations, utilities, and parking. Projects for site preparation are subject to the statutoryapproval limitations for new construction. A construction project must result in a complete and usable facility. In thecase of site preparation projects, the \u201ccomplete and usable facility\u201d is the prepared site. Accordingly, for projectapproval purposes, the work to prepare each distinct site is a project. Generally, in order to be \u201cdistinct,\u201d a site ischaracterized by the following:\n (a) Independent of work at any other site to be \u201ccomplete and usable.\u201d\n (b) Independent of mission function at any other site to be \u201ccomplete and usable.\u201d\n (c) Site preparation work on no other site is dependent on it.\n (2) Site preparation costs must be combined into one project for approval purposes for sites that are interdependent,\n but may be separately approved for sites that are interrelated. Interrelated contiguous sites are considered distinct andseparate as long as each site is prepared as a complete and useable independent project.\n d. Expense and/or investment threshold. The expense and/or investment threshold applies to the purchase and\n assembly and does not include delivery and setup.\n e. Delivery and setup. The process of bringing the relocatable components from the point of origin to the point of\n destination and includes all work necessary to unload and stage the components. Delivery and setup will be locallyapproved.\n f. Purchase and assembly. Procurement of the relocatable components and work necessary to have a complete\n building or system, excluding delivery and setup. Assembly includes connection to existing utility systems. Purchaseand assembly are included in the approval request.\n g. Personal property. Purchased relocatable buildings and/or facilities are inventoried, accounted for with item\n unique identification which will be tied to a specific approval document.\n h. Services contracts. Services contracts will not be used to acquire relocatable buildings and/or facility.\n i. Approval. Army relocatable building and/or facility approval and redelegation authorities action include the\n commander, IMCOM, NGB, ACOM, ASCC, and DRU commanders, or Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army(Installations and Housing) lease (nonbase realignment and closure) Time: known", "doc_id": "7b8bb626-0c8c-4cab-b287-9113cda58cb7", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0a161ffbb5ee73797eb48ebd8a10f45bea9e279f1cfafcc52e81500e4c646c3e", "extra_info": {"regulation": "AR735-5", "section_number": "4-7", "section_name": "General policy"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 4146, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": 589, "3": "522fd787-6736-4343-9f07-54e205a4d8f1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "522fd787-6736-4343-9f07-54e205a4d8f1": {"__data__": {"text": "Army(Installations and Housing) lease (nonbase realignment and closure) Time: known requirement 1 year or less and cost:\n total lease $100,000 or less.

Purchase of relocatable building and/or facility as personal property.(1) Approval authority for purchase of relocatable buildings and/or facilities is based on per-building cost. Construc-\n tion projects for site preparation for relocatable buildings and/or facilities will be approved in accordance with militaryconstruction authorities based on the total estimated funded project cost. The validated requirement for site preparationmay not be fragmented or met in a piece meal fashion in order to circumvent statutory military construction funding orconstruction approval limitations. The acquisition cost of relocatable buildings and/or facilities is an unfunded construc-tion project cost.

As the AMEDD TMDE manager, USAMMA will manage, direct, and control the AMEDD special -pur-\n pose TMDE Program.  \n (1)  U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity ( USAMMDA) will provide life cycle management \n for all type classified medical special -purpose TMDE in support of TOE medical organizations. Special -\n purpose TMDE life cycle management includes the acquisition, approval, repair, calibration, and the mod-\n ernization of special -purpose TMDE.  \n (2)  All TMD E will be calibrated in accordance with calibration intervals specified in TB 43  \u2013  180. \n (3)  TMDE required by the AMEDD Army school curriculum to prov ide individual training will not require \n cyclic calibration unless training efficiency or safety is adversely affected. U.S. Army Medical Command \n policy specifies that all general -purpose TMDE and special -purpose TMDE used in AMEDD school train-\n ing cours es will be calibrated.  \n  \n (4)  U.S. Army Medical Materiel Center \u2013Europe is the designated alternate source to provide repair and \n calibration support services for type classified medical special -purpose TMDE within the European Com-\n mand.  \n (5)  USAMMA Medical M aintenance Operations Divisions, Tracy, CA and U.S. Army Medical Materiel \n Center \u2013Europe activities providing special -purpose TMDE Calibration and Repair Support will establish \n and maintain an instrument master record file.  \n c.  Non-type classified medical special -purpose TMDE support will be accomplished as follows:  \n (1)  All special -purpose TMDE owners or users will perform operator level maintenance.  \n (2)  Special -purpose TMDE repair and calibration support will be obtained in accordan ce with TB \n 43  \u2013  180 or by contract maintenance support.  \n (3)  Special -purpose TMDE calibration intervals are specified in TB 43  \u2013  180 or manufacturer instruc-\n tions.  \n d.  Units are responsible to validate current requirements with on -hand TMDE.  \n (1)  Coordina tion must be done with the USAMMA and the TMDE support center to ensure that excess \n or obsolete TMDE has proper disposition.  \n (2)  Commanders will coordinate through Army Futures Command ( AFC) and TRADOC  (U.S. Army \n Combined Arms Support Command) for requests to modify or change TOE documents and forward to the \n DCS, G  \u2013  3/5/7 Organizational Integrator for review by DCS, G  \u2013  3/5/7 (DAMO).

Nuclear Hardness Maintenance and Hardness Surveillance Program  \n a.  Objective.   The objective of the Nuclear HM/HS Program is to ensure the su rvivability of mission crit-\n ical systems to the effects of nuclear weapons; to protect the investment made in hardening systems; and \n to ensure compliance with DoDI 3150.09, which directs the Secretary of the Army to \u201cEnsure an Nuclear \n HM/HS Program is est ablished and maintained for those CBRN mission critical systems that are hard-\n ened for nuclear survivability.\u201d  \n b.  Applicability.  \n (1)  The Nuclear HM/HS Program applies to those systems that are identified as mission critical by their \n capabilities documen ts, that have nuclear survivability requirements, and that incorporate hardening to \n meet those requirements, in accordance with DoDI 3150.09. The U.S. Army Nuclear and Combating \n Weapons of Mass Destruction Agency maintains the list of Army mission critica l systems with nuclear \n hardness requirements.  \n (2)  The systems hardness are the aspects of the system that protect it from initial nuclear weapons ef-\n fects, including high -altitude electromagnetic pulse, initial nuclear radiation, blast, and thermal radiati on. \n (3)  This maintenance policy is independent of hardness assurance.  \n c.  Program policy.  \n  \n (1)  Hardness maintenance is a unit responsibility. Effective nuclear hardness maintenance depends on \n proper maintenance in accordance with a system\u2019s TMs. Hardness  maintenance begins with routine \n PMCS. MATDEVs will develop checks and services requirements and ensure they are included in mis-\n sion critical systems\u2019 TMs.  \n (2)  Hardness surveillance is the responsibility of the MATDEV. Hardness surveillance will be co n-\n ducted while the system is located at depot maintenance and inspected by a U.S. Army Test and Evalua-\n tion Command ( ATEC) engineer. Hardness maintenance service checks must be completed before any \n standard maintenance work is done. The intent of hardness s urveillance is to monitor the hardness \n maintenance program and ensure the system\u2019s integrity remains intact through its life cycle. Hardness \n surveillance will be based on a portion of the fielded fleet.  \n d.  Responsibilities.  \n (1)  The MATDEV will \u2014 \n (a)  Ensure that nuclear hardness maintenance checks and services are incorporated into a system\u2019s \n TMs. These checks and services include but are not limited to ensuring wire casings are serviceable, criti-\n cal items are properly grounded, and electrical connection s are free of corrosion.  \n (b)  Ensure that detailed life cycle HM/HS Programs are incorporated into the supportability strategy \n (SS), in accordance with DA Pam 700  \u2013  127. In the SS, include maintenance concepts, requirements, and \n procedures for nuclear HM/HS procedures to assure the nuclear hardness of the system throughout its \n life cycle. Maintenance actions, replacement of parts, modifications and other life cycle changes require  a \n reassessment of the system\u2019s vulnerability.  \n (c)  Include life cycle surveillance and maintenance of electromagnetic environmental effects shielding \n or hardening features in the ILS assessment and planning processes, in accordance with DA Pam 70  \u2013  3. \n The MATDEV will consider the following in support of HM/HS planning: maintenance planning, technical \n data, training and training support, computer resources support, and design interface. Equipment tech-\n nical publications will delineate and describe nuclea r HM/HS requirements.  \n (d)  Verify HM/HS maintenance procedures and review the technical publications during the logistics \n demonstration, in accordance with DoD 3235.2  \u2013  R.

This authority \n is meant to support near -term readiness when the supply posture for a given item is in a weak position. \n These tasks are marked with the MRC D or L in the a pplicable TM MAC. Depot maintenance work in the \n Army will be tightly controlled to ensure component quality, safety of equipment operation, and to comply \n with U.S. law. There are two methods of delegations to perform depot maintenance: SRA and OTR.  \n b.  Special repair authority (Project Code 065).   SRA (Project Code 065) is an authorization by AMC to \n provide a maintenance organization with authority to perform maintenance to the national standard on an \n item of equipment for a period not to exceed 1 yea r. The following policy applies to SRA:  \n (1)  Work performed under an SRA will be directly funded with customer operation and maintenance \n (O&M) appropriation funds.  \n (2)  SRA approval will be based on the overall stock position of an asset. SRAs will no t be approved \n when like serviceable assets are available and/or where assets exist to meet readiness and/or mission \n needs within required timelines. Army policy is not to repair more than national requirements.  \n (3)  Only maintenance organizations that have  the technical skills, tools, test equipment, necessary fa-\n cilities, QA (inspection), and testing capability to perform DLRs will be approved. These qualifications \n must be confirmed by the appropriate LCMC in accordance with their published internal oper ating proce-\n dures and the NMP Business Process Manual ( BPM).  \n (4)  SRAs will not be approved for items that are on the NMP current and subsequent FY workload \n plan.  \n (5)  An SRA will not be required for those SORs  that have been technically certified to perform DLRs in \n accordance with the applicable national standard in support of the NMP (Army working capital fund \n (AWCF)).  \n (6)  SRA renewals are allowed when a requirement still exists for the basic SRA approve d workload for \n 1 year. If required, the initiator will begin the renewal process 90 days before the expiration of the original \n SRA.  \n (7)  The NMP solution in LMP will be used to apply for SRA authorizations. Instructions for accessing \n and using this sol ution are contained in the NMP BPM. The NMP solution in LMP provides an automated \n process to manage the creation, workflow, reporting, review, and approval process for SRA\u2019s.  \n  \n (8)  Commander, AMC may delegate approval or disapproval authority to the LCMCs. This delegation \n of authority is addressed in AMC\u2019s NMP BPM.  \n (9)  The total processing time for each SRA request will not exceed 60 calendar -days. If the repair of an \n item involves a CSI, then the LCMC processing time will be extended to 60 day s, and the total processing \n time will be extended to 120 days.  \n (10)  If a requesting organization does not agree with the LCMCs disapproval of an SRA request, they \n may request the SRA disapproval be reviewed by DCS, G  \u2013  4 by using the rebuttal process as defined in \n the NMP BPM.  \n c.

Respective State  Adjutant Gener-\n als operationally control the four TASMGs and the HQ, ADMRU during garrison operations with direct \n doctrinal and operational guidance from the NGB Aviation and Safety Division. TASMGs perform back up \n field and sustainment -level maintena nce on ARNG aircraft and components in support of the ARNG Army \n Aviation Support Facilities. Performing NMP work, SRAs, and OTRs maintains required skill sets, as well \n as supports the ARNG aviation aircraft fleet.

AMC may also mobilize the TASMGs, \n as well as the HQ, ADMRU (to be converted to a TASMG HQ & HQ Detachment) and deploy them to \n augment AMC forward commands in operations. The TASMGs will operate the TAMP when deployed to \n an area of operations. The TAMP equipment package is a like set of equipment (that each TASMG has \n and operates) that will dep loy forward to be used and operated by the TASMG personnel during deploy-\n ments. The TAMP equipment package plus the sustainment level skills of the TASMG personnel provide \n the aviation sustainment capability forward at the TAMP.

The FRA will contact CECOM, SEC \u2013Lee for replacement of equipment. The FRA may man-\n age RCF at each  facility. This capability provides additional recovery capability. The local FRA manager \n will determine when replacement of SASMO work ordered equipment is needed.  \n (2)  The decision to repair and/or upgrade NS  \u2013  E computers, personal digital assistants , AIT, and asso-\n ciated devices will be based upon a cost -benefit analysis of replacing versus repairing and/or upgrading \n the system. With the rapid advancement in technology, the repair and/or upgrade of logistics IT equip-\n ment may not be the best economic  choice. The following factors should be considered during the deci-\n sion process:  \n (a)  Cost of replacement from General Services Administration ( GSA) schedule.  \n (b)  Warranty and/or no warranty.  \n (c)  Age of the equipment (consider substantially improved technology).  \n (d)  Mission impact while the system is being repaired and/or upgraded.  \n (e)  Extent of repair and/or upgrade.  \n (f)  Cost of repair and/or upgrade versus the MEL constraints.  \n (g)  Availability of parts.  \n (h)  Manpower availability versu s manpower required in accomplishing the repair and/or upgrade.  \n (i)  Estimated service life after repair and/or upgrade.  \n (j)  Most timely method of getting system back into the hands of the end user.  \n (3)  The maintenance of MTOE and/or TDA military equip ment and standard/common and/or unique \n Army systems will have priority over the repair of locally procured logistics IT computer systems. The cu-\n mulative cost to repair or upgrade a logistics IT computer must not exceed 65 percent of the replacement \n cost of the individual LRU (the central processing unit, monitor, and printer). Accounting of expenditures \n for each LRU (by serial number) is the responsibility of the repair activity. Units must be able to produce \n records when required, such as \u2014 \n (a)  Copy of buy versus repair cost -benefit analysis. If audited, the unit must be able to produce these \n reports upon direction from higher HQs.  \n (b)  Cost of expenditures and work requests in support of the logistics IT computer repair and/or up-\n grade effort must be maintained. If audited, the repair shop must be able to produce these reports upon \n direction from higher HQs.  \n (4)  Logistics IT equipment computer will not be upgraded if the upgrade requires replacement of more \n than 50 percent of the internal major shop replaceable units or assemblies (motherboard, hard drive, disk \n drive, compact disk, central processor, and memory c hips).  \n (5)", "doc_id": "e857fe07-8b98-47db-99db-4f466e12a896", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d182a32e3435f9f79ccf372914b5c0ac865e605e00fae7d66c3ee0d0ecffd29e", "extra_info": {"regulation": "AR750-1", "section_number": "8-12", "section_name": "General"}, "node_info": {"start": 11456, "end": 15300, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": 800, "2": "25f287a3-cc9b-4f2f-a9e5-d079fd7c4e9d", "3": "833da359-b3a9-4e70-8620-8682d222dccb"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "833da359-b3a9-4e70-8620-8682d222dccb": {"__data__": {"text": "\n drive, compact disk, central processor, and memory c hips).  \n (5)  Upgrade of a logistics IT computer must retain the original system configuration integrity of fit and \n form.
